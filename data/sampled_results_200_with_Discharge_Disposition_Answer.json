Respiratory failure: prolonged wean last admission requiring\ntracheostomy, also remains NPO as concern for aspiration as well\nas source of resp failure. Based on CXR unchanged bilateral\nopacities- cont trach with vent support as needed and wean as\ntolerated at Rehab.\nPatient was continued on pressure support at 5/5 and trach\ncollar as tolerated. He was on trach collar for the last four\ndays of this admission without switching to PS.\nPatient had completed 10 day courses of Levaquin/zosyn/Vanc last\nadmission and has been stable from infectious standpoint and no\ngrowth on cultures. No new antibiotics were started on this\nadmission.\n*\n2. BRBPR: on exam here consistent with guiaic negative stools,\nbut +internal hemorrhoids- likely source of bleed. Hct 28 this\nadmission but has been stable at this- all of last admission.\nIron studies last admission consistent with iron deficiency and\nchronic disease and likely HAART.  Patient was started on iron\nfor presumed iron deficiency. Patient was started on epogen for\nHIV related bone marrow toxicity as well as renal insufficiency.\n*\n3.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "48 F with ID-T2DM, Trisomy 21, OSA, presents with hypotension\nand hyperglycemia, found in septic shock.\n.\n#. Septic Shock/Fevers: Prior to presentation patient had\nsymptoms of gastroenteritis.  On presentation to the ED, her VS:\n97.8 63 108/78 22 95%.  She was found to have a Lactate 6.0,\nGluc 500. Fluid resuscitation was attempted with over 6L of\ncrystalloid (4LNS, 2L LR total). A right IJ cordis was placed.\nPressors were begun with Levo and then neosynephrine, however\nsbp remained in the 70's. She was intubated for agitation during\na-line placement. Zosyn and vancomycin were started and urine\nand blood cultures were sent, though it was unclear whether it\nwas before the abx. CXR revealed mild pulmonary congestion\nthough no obvious infiltrate. Repeat Lactate after volume\nresucitation was 3. Vital signs at the time of transfer were HR\n104, BP94/43, 100% on 100%. In the ICU her antibiotics were\nbroadened to include atypical pneumonia.  She was resusitated\nwith 9 liters of fluid her first hospital day. She continued to\nrequire levophed to maintain MAP>60. On  patient was\nbriefly started 50 mg IV hydrocort, while awaiting AM Cortisol\nand stim test, which revealed normal adrenal function. Vigeleo\nhemodynamic monitoring was placed and patient had no evidence of\ncardiogenic failure, with excellent cardiac output. CV02 sat was\n86% further ruling out cardiogenic failure and confirming likely\nsepsis and distributive shock. Evaluation for sources of\ninfection continued though proved unfruitful. Patient was ruled\nout for influenza. CT of the abdomen and pelvis were performed\nto further evaluate for source of infection and fat stranding\nabout the pancreas and part of duodenum was found which could\nsuggest pancreatitis or duodenitis. RUQ ultrasound was without\nevidence of hepatic abscess or cholecystitis. Given findings of\nduodentitis Cipro and Flagyl were started. Blood cultures,\nurine, sputum cultures were negative, though later  urine a\nsputum cultures revealed colonization with . On patient started on a trial of vasopressin in an attempt to wean\nfrom levophed. Patient continued to intermittently wean from\npressors and it was felt that much of her pressor requirement\nwas dependent on sedation. On  was briefly off of pressors.\nOn  Vancomycin and Zosyn were DC'd and PICC line placed.\nLater that day patient became febrile and B-Glucan and\nGalactomannan were sent and she was started Aztreonam,\nMicafungin and vancomycin. Cipro/flagyl were continued. On Abx pared down and Aztreonam was DC'd leaving flagyl, cipro,\nvanc, micafungin. On  Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl\nwere stopped, though later that day the patient spike to 101.3\nand became tachycardic and hypotensive, intermittently requiring\nlevophed. Random cortisol was rechecked and low compared to\nadmission at 8.7. Steroids were not started given improvement in\nblood pressure. At that time Vancomycin, Cefepime,\nCiprofloxacin, flagyl were restarted. To further evaluate for\nsource of fever LENI's were performed and negative. RUQ\nultrasound repeated and again was without evidence of hepatic\nabscess or cholecystitis. On  antibiotics were stopped\ngiven no source of infection.\n.\n#. Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated during ED course\ngiven altered mental status in the setting of hypotension.\nDuring her early ICU course the patient was supported with\nAssist Control given her NSTEMI and pressor requirement. These\nwere felt to be contraindications to extubation. As her sepsis\nresolved the patient the patients urine output dropped off and\nbecame 27 liters positive with evidence of pulmonary edema on\nchest xray. As noted below patient was aggressively diuresed\nwith IV lasix then eventually CVVH with improvement in\nrespiratory status and reassuring RSBIs and SBT. On patient was eventually extubated, intially did well, joking with\nfamily, then developed stridor, and was re-intubated. The cause\nof her stridor was felt to be multifactorial as anesthesia\nthought that she had an arytenoid dislocation (from traumatic\nintubation) and edematous upper airway. Diuresis was continued\nand the possibility of another trial of extubation was\nconsidered though it was felt this would be high risk given the\npatient's difficult intubations previously. On  thoracic\nsurgery placed perc trach. Patient quickly weaned to trach mask\nand was eventually transferred to the floor. On the floor, the\ntracheostomy was reduced in size and a PMV was placed. The\npatient was saturating 100% on room air via the tracheostomy\ncollar at the time of discharge.\n.\n#. Arytenoid Dislocation: ENT came by an evaluated the patient.\nThere was terrific edema; it was also too difficult to see the\nsubglottic area. the epiglottis was plump. Additionally, there\nwas a gap in her vocal cords. Essentially, nothing was found\nthat could explain airway difficulties; the vocal cord gap can\nbe addressed as an outpatient endoscopically. and additional\nhistory implies that some degree of her difficulties talking\nwere present before the hospitalization. Finally, ENT\nreccommended a PPI to protect the cords from acid. She has ENT\nfollowup at 2 weeks post discharge.\n.\n#. Acute Kidney Injury: Patient presented in acute kidney injury\nwith creatinine of 2.6. Through her stay in the ICU her\ncreatinine worsened to 7.1 on  before she was started on\nCVVH. Nephrology was consulted and felt that  was secondary\nto ATN in the setting of sepsis. Urine sediment revealed muddy\nbrown cast. Renal ultrasound was without obstruction. Prior to\nstarting CVVH patient was trialed on lasix gtt and intially put\nout well though was not able to keep up with her daily intake.\nPrior to transfer to the floor the patient was off CVVH for\nseveral days and continued to make excellent urine with\nstabilization in her creatinine.  Upon discharge, her Creatinine\nwas 2.0 and down-trending. She may establish a new baseline\n(higher than her baseline of 0.9 prior to admission). She has\nPCP  to recheck her Chem-7 and restart her lisinopril\nif her kidneys will tolerate it.\n.\n#. T2DM with DKA vs. HONK: Uncertain DKA vs. HONK. Interestingly\nacetone negative on admission. Insulin gtt was initiated and\npatient was supported with IVF, lab monitored every 4 hours with\nresolution of anion gap.  was consulted and helped manage\nglucose control. Her insulin regimen was uptitrated (see\nattached insulin flowchart). Upon discharge, she was getting\nlantus 25 units with breakfast in addition to an humalog insulin\nsliding scale qac/hs.\n.\n#. Hypothyroidism: 125 mcg of levothyroxine was continued. TSH\nwas measured during ICU course and revealed likely sick\neuthyroid with TSH of 15.\n.\n#. Dyslipidemia: Patient was continued on home simvastatin.\n.\n#. NSTEMI versus Demand Ischemia: On day one of hospitalization\nEKG was repeated with concerning depressions anterolaterally\nwhich were new, however no documentation of EKG in emergency\ndepartment was found. Cardiac enzymes were measured and\nelevated, enzymes peaked with CK: 3000, CKMB: 200, TroponinT: 8.\nCardiology was consulted. Patient was given full dose aspirin,\nstatin, and heparin gtt. Heparin was continued for 72 hours.\nCardiac enzymes trended down. Of note, she was not started on a\nbeta-blocker because of her labile blood pressure. A\nbeta-blocker will need to be started as an outpatient by\ncardiology or her PCP (she has followup for both). An ACEI can\nbe considered after her renal failure resolves and based on her\nnew baseline creatinine.\n.\n#. Rash: Macular rash diffuse and blanching across the abdomen.\nDerm consulted and confirmed concerns for drug rash. Sarna was\napplied to abdomen and Zosyn was stopped as this is the most\nlikely culprit. Rash improved slowly over the following days.\n.\n#. Nutrition: Patient was supported with tube feeds during her\nICU course. Nutrition recs: nutren pulmonary at 30mg/hr with 21\ngrams of benprotein.\n.\n#:Left UE swelling: US without DVT.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr.  is a 55 yo M with PMH of Insulin Dependent Diabetes\nMellitus, Hypertension, history of CVA (per patient), who was\nfound down at group home with fingerstick of 20. In the ED\ncontinued to drop sugars inspite of D50 so was started on D5\ndrip and admitted to intensive care unit for frequent\nmonitoring.\n\n# Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 and Hypoglycemia:\nPatient remained on D5W drip overnight in the intensive care\nunit with fasting sugars rising from 140s to 200s by the morning\nand improvement of mental status. In the morning, the patient\nwas started on a diabetic diet with subcutaneous insulin sliding\nscale   diabetes consulting team's recommendations. His\nfingersticks continued to rise to 300s.  He was started on a\nbasal  dose of 25u at bedtime, decreased from dose of\n38u which he was taking at home each morning.  Mr.  was\ntransferred to the floor for further management.  On the floor,\nthe patient's blood sugars remained elevated to the 200s-400s,\nand his  dose was increased slowly to 35u at bedtime\nwith Humalog sliding scale before meals and at bedtime.  The\npatient continued to have somewhat elevated blood sugars in the\n200s with this regimen, highest sugars being at night and lowest\nsugars (170-190) before breakfast.\n\nHe was discharged on this regimen because it was felt that he\nwill be safer with higher blood sugars than lower blood sugars.\nThe long-term blood risks of high blood sugars and the need to\nfollow a good diabetic diet were explained to the patient, but\nhis insight into the subject appears to be at least somewhat\nlimited; he has had much diabetic education in the past and\ncontinues to have difficulty with diet compliance.  He does\nadminister his own insulin at the group home, but the\nadministration is monitored by staff.  There did not appear to\nbe any medical conditions causing the frequent hypoglycemia.\n\nThe discharge insulin regimen includes  35units at\nbedtime in addition to a Novolog sliding scale as attached\nbefore each meal and at bedtime. The patient should be\nsupervised with insulin administration.\n\nPatient was noted to have polyuria and polydipsia during this\nhospitalization which are apparently chronic symptoms for him;\nhe explains that he has had these symptoms for years.  He was\ngiven intravenous fluids in the setting of hyperglycemia and\nintravascular volume depletion.  It appears that he must have\nvery frequent hyperglycemia at home.\n\nHe appears to frequently get both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia\nat home, but the primary medical team during this\nhospitalization felt that the hypoglycemic episodes were more\nconcerning at this time because of their immediate danger.  The\npatient would benefit from further diabetic education.\n\n# Altered Mental Status:\nPatient presented with altered mental status of slurred speech\nand significantly decreased responsiveness.  He does have\nbaseline psychiatric disorder, remote seizure history and\npossible borderline mental retardation.  His toxicology screen\nwas negative on admission.  His altered mental status was felt\nto be secondary to hypoglycemia, as it normalized with the\nnormalization of blood sugars and administration of intravenous\nthiamine.  It was felt by the medical ICU team that he may have\ntemporarily developed thiamine deficiency in the setting of\nglucose-loading on presentation.  He was continued on oral\nthiamine supplements just during the hospitalization. By the\nmorning after admission, the patient was felt to be back at\nbaseline, Alert and Oriented x3, although tangential.\nPsychiatric medications had been held initially and restarted\nthe morning after admission after improvement in mental status.\n\n\n# History of Seizure Disorder\nPatient has remote history of seizure disorder.  Per his primary\ncare physician,  has not had a seizure in many years.  He is\ntaking phenytoin and was noted to have a low level of 4.7 on\nadmission.  Given subtherapeutic phenytoin level, he was given\nan extra one-time loading dose of phenytoin 7mg/kg (70kg),\n500mg, then restarted on his home dosing. His level may be\nre-checked at his followup primary care appointment next week.\nHe was also restarted on his valproic acid the morning after\nadmission.\n\n# Anemia\nPer iron studies, patient may have anemia of chronic disease\nbecause TIBC is low, though ferritin is also on low normal side\nat 58. RBCs are normocytic. Hematocrit remained stable, and\npatient showed no signs of bleeding.\n\n# Bipolar Mood Disorder\nPatient appeared stable during this hospitalization.  He was\ncontinued on valproic acid, risperidone, lorazepam at bedtime,\nand quetiapine on the floor.\n\n# Hypertension\nPatient's lisinopril and propranolol were initially held,\nresulting in elevated blood pressures; his blood pressures were\nbetter controlled after restarting these medications.\n\n# Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\nPatient was continued on his proton pump inhibitor.\n\n# Communication:\nPatient and group home -   in , MA\nSister  is   .\n  (another Guardian, deals w Psych Meds)\n(\n# FULL CODE",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "60 yo M with h/o LURT and pancreas (failed) after kidney\npresented to the ED with massive GI bleed concerning for fistula\nbetween pancreatic allograft and bowel. He was sent emergently\nto IR for localization of bleed. Mesenteric Angiogram did not\nreveal any extravasation. Several hours later, he experienced\nanother massive GI bleed and was taken back for angiography that\ndemonstrated likely fistula from the artery in the pancreatic\nallograft to the small bowel. The balloon was inflated in the\nright common iliac artery to achieve control. He experienced\nhypovolemia as well as  compartment syndrome and coded. ACLS\nprotocol was initiated with resuscitation. He required emergent\nexploratory laparotomy in radiology with ligation of arterial\ninflow to pancreatic allograft, small bowel resection, bilateral\nchest tube placement, and removal of percutaneously placed right\ncommon iliac balloon. Surgeon was Dr.  . See operative\nnote for complete details. Postop, he was taken intubated to the\nSICU. Chest tubes remained to water seal without pneumothorax\nnoted on CXR. Insulin drip was started.\n\nOn , he was taken to the OR by Dr.   for\nexploratory laparotomy with enteroenterostomy and abdominal wall\nclosure. Postop, he returned to the SICU intubated. On , a\nbronchoscopy was done for mucus plugs. BAL was negative. He\nreceived broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. A lasix drip was\nstarted for massive edema.\n\nOn , he was extubated with chest tubes remaining to water\nseal. Lasix drip continued. On , interventional radiology\nplaced a right common iliac artery covered stent over the\narterio-jejunal fistula. A post pyloric tube was also placed by\nradiology. Radiology removed the bilateral groin sheaths without\nincident. On , bilateral CT's were removed with post CXR\ndemonstrating a tiny L apical PTX that resolved spontaneously.\n\nPlavix 300mg was initiated. Trophic trophic tube feeds were\nstarted and advanced to goal. Free water flushes were given for\nhypernatremia. On  2 units of PRBC were given for a Hct of\n23.4. Hct remained stable. On , Vanco and Zosyn were started\nfor empiric pneumonia coverage. CXR showed bilateral perihilar\n(right greater than left)and bibasilar (left greater than right)\nopacities and bilateral pleural effusions. Lasix drip was\ncontinued for generalized edema.\n\nNG tube was removed and diet was advanced to a DM diet. Insulin\ndrip continued. Aspirin was restarted. Oxycodone was given for\npain control. He developed a metabolic alkalosis and Lasix drip\nwas held. Diamox was given x2. Urine output remained adequate.\n\nOn , he was pancultured for leukocytosis (13.6, 12.8). Blood\nand urine cultures remained negative. CXR showed improved\npleural effusions. CMV and BK viral loads were sent and returned\nnegative.\n\nOn , he self-d/c'd the feeding tube and was experiencing\nnausea and bilious emesis. KUB did not show signs of\nobstruction. On , a CT scan with PO contrast demonstrated\npartial SBO dilated bowel proximal to anastomosis and\ndecompressed bowel distally, positive contrast in colon. He was\nkept NPO and was started on TPN. NG continued with bilious\noutput. On , Hct was 21 and he was transfused with 2U RBC.\nBMs appeared bloody. He also experienced mental status changes\nand decreased movement of LLE. Head CT demonstrated no evidence\nof territorial infarction or hemorrhage. Of note on , LENIS\nwere done for R>L leg swelling. No DVT was seen.\n\nOn  PRBC were given for Hct of 23 with increase to 29\nwhere he stabilized. Mental status improved. NG was removed. On\n, he was transferred out of the SICU. Diet was slowly\nadvanced and TPN continued. Insulin drip was converted to\nGlargine and regular sliding scale. He experienced frequent\nnon-bloody stools. Stool was sent for C.diff and was negative\nX2. A postpyloric feeding tube was placed on  for\ninsufficient Kcals. Isosource 1.5 was started with goal of\n50cc/hr identified by the Dietician. TPN was stopped on .\nInsulin was adjusted.\n\nPT was consulted and worked with him daily initially noting\northostasis and patient complaints of dizziness. These signs and\nsymptoms improved with improved mobility. PT recommended rehab\ndue to deconditioning from long hospitalization. The day of\ndischarge, patient is tolerating scant amounts of a regular diet\nand receiving tube feeds. Patient is alert and oriented. Midline\nincision is clean, dry, and intact with steri strips. Vital\nsigns are stable. Insulin basal dose and sliding scale were\nadjusted to lantus 10 units in AM/ 18 units in PM. Patient is\npending discharge to  rehab.",

Urosepsis / Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension\nwith SBP 70s, in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and\nwith UA suggestive of UTI.  There were no other focal signs of\ninfection.  Patient was started on vanco/cefepime for broad\ncoverage given history of recurrent UTIs.  Patient had a CVL\nplaced and received aggressive fluid resuscitation (about 5L).\nHe was started on pulse dose steroids with hydrocortisone; home\nmetoprolol and lasix were held.  SBP rose to the 90-110s.\nSteroids were eventually returned to pre-admission taper.  As\nurosepsis resolved and rate control was obtained, hypotension\nresolved.  He did not require pressor support.  His urine\nculture grew Proteus sensitive to all cephalosporins and his\nantibiotics were changed to cefpodoxime for a total 10 day\ncourse.\n\n#. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  He was started on digoxin for\nrate control for atrial fibrillation given hypotension.  His\nrate responded well.  His blood pressure remained very sensitive\nto beta blockade, and his metoprolol was not restarted.  If he\ncontinues to have tachycardia, could restart slowly after\ndischarge.  His HR at discharge was 80-110.  Digoxin level was\ncheckced and was 1.7 on the day of discharge.\n\n#. Acute on chronic renal failure: He was admitted with Cr 2.5\nfrom baseline creatinine of 1.5 which was felt to be pre-renal\nin etiology in the setting of urosepsis.  Creatinine improved\nwith IV fluid resuscitation.  Lasix was held initially on\nadmission.  Once  resolved and patient fully fluid\nresuscitated, home lasix resumed.\n\n#. Hyperkalemia: Patient had K 7.5 on presentation without EKG\nchanges.  He was treated with calcium gluconate, insulin and\ndextrose, and kayexalate (once able to take PO).  Etiology\nthought to be  renal failure and baseline potassium\nsupplementation.  Once urinary output improved, potassium\nreturned to  value.\n\n#. Diabetes mellitus: Continued insulin sliding scale while in\nhouse.  His long-acting NPH was held as he did not initially\nhave oral intake.  His blood sugars ranged 80-250 while in the\nhospital, although started to trend up to high 100's by the time\nof discharge.  His NPH will likely need to be restarted slowly\nin the next 1-2 days.\n\n#. Hyperlipidemia: Statin resumed once patient stabilized on\nadmission.\n\n#. RLE swelling: He had LENIs negative for DVT.  It was felt\nthat he likely has chronic venous insufficiency.\n\n#. Other meds.  His other medications were held initially in the\nsetting of lethargy including allopurinol, ASA, citalopram,\ncranberry, Os-Cal, omeprazole, tylenol, benadryl, dulcolax,\nimodium milk of magnesia, robitussin, vicodin.  These can be\nrestarted after discharge.  His home prednisone taper and\nsimvastatin have already been restarted.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "This is an 80 yo F with h/o paranoid schizophrenia, anoxic brain\ninjury, and advanced dementia with recent aspiration event\npresented from her nursing home with acute shortness of breath\nand hypoxia.  She was admitted to the ICU.\n\n#. Hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was intubated on .\n Her respiratory failure was likely  aspiration pneumonitis\nand complicated by HAP and pulmonary edema with systolic CHF\n(LVEF 20-25%) from IVF resucitation.  Her sputum grew out staph\naureus and 2 strains of E. coli (see labs for details), so she\nwas treated with antibiotics clindamycin and aztreonam for a\ntotal of 8 days completed on  (D1 ).  She was\nactively diuresed toward the end of her ICU stay and CXR showed\nimprovement of her effusion.  She was successfully extubated on\n after discussion with family regarding goals of care\nand status of no reintubation.  PT WAS MADE  by her nephew.\nSHE IS NOT TO BE REHOSPITALIZED.  DNR/DNI\n\n#. Sepsis, likely  pneumonia and bacteremia.  Patient\ninitially had hypotention requiring pressors that was thought to\nbe  sedation for intubation, but also had acute respiratory\nfailure, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.  There\nwas concern of possible teeth abscess, but CT head was not able\nto capture and Panorex X ray was not possible given intubated\nstatus.  She has 2 sources of infection- HAP with MSSA and 2\nstrains of E. coli and coag negative staph aureus bacteremia.\nRIJ CVL was placed and PICC (placed prior to admission  at\nShirrel House) line was removed.  A-line was placed for\nmonitoring initially, but waveforms were suboptimal despite\nattempts to replace it, so ultimately, it was discontinued as\npatient was weaned off pressor.  These infections were treated\nwith clindamycin, aztreonam, and vancomycin with 8 day course\nfor HAP and further treatment for her bacteremia was held given\nthat she was made .\n\n#. Bacteremia, likely  to PICC line infection (placed on\n for treatment of recent aspiration pneumonia).  Blood cx\nshowed coag negative staph as well as enterococcus faecalis,\nsuggesting PICC line infection although PICC tip was cultured\nnegative.  She received antibiotics vancomycin to treat for the\nbacteremia as both bacteriae were susceptible, starting on\n.  The initial plan was to treat for 14 days.  However,\nantibiotics were discontinued after lengthy discussion with\nfamily/HCP who wanted to direct her care to comfort measure on\n.\n\n#. Pneumonia, likely HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia.  Patient has\nknown history of aspiratioy and was recently treated for\naspiration pneumonia prior to this admission.  Sputum grew out\nE. Coli and coag + staph aureus.  Antibiotics clindamycin and\naztreonam were chosen based on sensitivity and she was treated\nfor a total of 8 day course for HAP (D1, ) and\ncompleted on .  Repeat CXR showed improvement of the\nbibasilar opacification, which could also be atelectasis.\n\n#. Cardiac ischemia, likely from demand with active diuresis and\nrecent sepsis.  This was noted on  when telemetry\nmonitoring revealed new T-wave inversion with troponin up to\n0.14.  A discussion was held with patient's HCP regarding\ntherapy for the demand ischemia, and a decision was made to hold\noff further monitoring and intervention given her significant\ncomorbidities and that the risk likely outweighs the benefit of\nanticoagulation.\n\n#. Anemia.  Likely  anemia of chronic inflammation and\nsepsis.  She was on stress ulcer prophylaxis, and there is no\nsigns of GI bleeding.  She received a total of 2 units of pRBC\nafter discussion with her HCP, and her Hct responded\nappropriately.\n\n#. Rash.  Diffuse pustular papular rash was noted on her back.\nShe was started on clotrimazole cream for likely fungal\ninfection.\n\n#. Schizophrenia/advanced dementia.  She continued with home\ncogentin, divalproex, and megace.  Trazodone was discontinued\ngiven her initial presentation.  Toward the end of ICU stay, her\nmental status was at baseline as compared to baseline per\nreport, which is awake, oriented x1, non-verbal, and bed-bound.\n\n\n#. Teeth abscess.  This was initially reported by nephew upon\nadmission.  However, CT scan was unable to characterize the\nabscess due to resolution and location of the abscess.  Given\nthat she was intubated, Panorex was unable to be performed.  No\ndefinitive therapy was performed, but the antibiotics that she\nreceived for her infection could be helpful in treating her\nabscess as well.\n\n# Anisorcia.  This was noted during admission.  She had\nasymmetric pupils R > L and less responsive.  It was unclear of\nthe chronicity and there was no known use of eye drops,\nbreathing therapy, pupil dilation, head trauma, or\nanticoagulation.  CT head did not show herniation or acute\nbleeding.\n\n#. Nutrition.  While patient was intubated, she was on tube\nfeeding based on nutrition recommendation.  After extubation,\npatient was started on pureed diet with thickend fluid for risk\nof aspiration as for comfort per family request.  It was noted\nthat patient continued to have signs of aspiration.\n\n#. Goals of Care.  Multiple discussions were carried out with\npatient's HCP (nephew)    and  is\nalternate contact ( wife)  throughout\npatient's ICU stay.  ICU consent form was kept up to date\nthroughout her ICU stay.  Patient was made comfort measure only\non  after the event with cardiac demand ischemia.  She\nwas successfully extubated on .  All therapeutic\nmedications were discontinued. PT was made  and is not to be\nrehospitalized, DNR/DNI.\n\n#. Comfort Measure Only.  This was started after discussion with\nfamily on .  She continued with Tylenol 650 mg q6h prn\nfor pain/fever, bisacodyl 10 mg daily prn, Miralax daily prn,\ndocusate 100 mg  prn, and clotrimazole for the rash on her\nback.  She was started on lorazepam 0.5-2mg IV q1h prn for\nagitation/anxiety and morphine 2-4 mg IV q1h for pain/SOB.  She\nwas also restarted on a puree diet with thickened fluid for\ncomfort with family/HCP aware of her aspiration risk.\n\n# Prophylaxis.  Subcutaneous heparin and pantoprazole 40 mg IV\ndaily throughout most part of her ICU staty until she was made\n on .\n\n# Communication:  (HCP) and  (HCP's wife).  nurse manager at  House  .",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "This patient presented to the Emergency Department and a\nemergent left ventriculostomy was placed at the bedside on\n. The external ventricular drain was left to drain at\n15cm H20.  A CTA of the head and neck was performed confirming a\nright MCA aneurysm. She was taken emergently for a cerebral\nangiogram and underwent coiling of a right MCA aneurysm. Post\noperatively she was transported to the Iintensive Care Unit. The\nSystolic Blood Pressure goal was 90-200. Intravenous fluid was\ncontinued but at 50ml/hr due to her poor respiratory status (CXR\nrevealed bilateral pleural effusions). Cardiac Enzymes were\nchecked and troponin was noted to be at 0.55. Due to this an\nechocardiogram was requested which revealed moderate to severe\nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis. Repeat troponin in AM was\n0.25.\n\nIn the AM  patient's ICP's were noted to increase to the\nupper 20's unstimulated. It was decided to bring the patient to\nthe OR for a decompressive craniectomy. This was performed\nurgently.  The patient underwent the procedure and was recovered\nin the Intensive Care Unit.A post operative Head CT was\nperformed which was consistent with right frontoparietal\ncraniectomy with expected postoperative changes including\npneumochephalus overlying the right frontoparietal lobes. There\nwas improved leftward shift of the midline structures to 2 mm\ncompared to 5 mm previously. Otherwise, right parietotemporal\nintraparenchymal hemorrhage\nand extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage had not significantly\nchanged, but there\nwas no evidence of new hemorrhage or mass effect. Left frontal\nventriculostomy catheter appears unchanged with tip in the third\nventricle.\n\nAn ECHO was performed which revealed an EF of 30%. a chest xray\nwas performed whichwas consistent with Bilateral diffuse lung\nopacities are persisting concerning for asymmetric pulmonary\nedema or pneumonia. Improvement in the left hemithorax opacity\ncould be due to difference in layering of the small effusion and\nposition or could be a true decrease in the opacities.\n\nA right subclavian line was placed.\n\nOn , a chest x ray was performed which showed no evidence of\npulmonary disease. The patient was requiring a neosynephrine gtt\nto maintain her systolic blood pressure above a goal of 100 and\ncontinued to be tachycardic.  The IVF was increased from 50cc/hr\nto 75 cc/hr and the patient was weaned off her vasopressor gtt\nper managemnet by the intensive care team.  The subgaeleal drain\nwas discontinued.  The external ventricular drain was open at 15\nH2Ommhg. On exam, when off propofol the patient did not follow\ncommands.  The patient did move all extremities with equal\nstrength/antigravity. Pupils were equal and reactive.  The\npatient was intubated and the ventilator settings were weaned to\nCPAP. The cardiac enzymes continued to trend down. On  she\nwas stable and off the neo gtt. Her bowel regimen was increased\nwhile awaiting a bowel movement and she had positive flatus. On\n she was tachycardic with a 2 point drop in her hematocrit\nso she received 1 unit of PRBC's. On  she was stable with\nplans for angiogram on .\n\nThe pt remained stable overnight of the 17th with ICP's of 6.\nHer exam was consistent.  She went for angiogram with possible\nintervention. During the angiogram she was noted to have severe\nvasospasm of the right MCA which required Intra-arterial\nverapamil and nitroglycerin were administered, and balloon\ndilatation of the right middle cerebral artery performed.\n\nOn , she returned for a cerebral angiogram which showed\nagain severe vasospasm which again required intra-arterial\nverapamil and nitroglycerin.  She remained stable with her EVD\nat 20cmH20.  She continued to require pressors to increase\ncerebral perfusion pressures.  Her neuro exam improved with\npressor.  On  a repeat head ct showed new right frontal\ninfarcts and right temporal infarct. However, her neuro exam\nremained stable.  Due to respiratory failure, patient required a\ntracheostomy which was performed in routine fashion.\n\nAdditionally, given that her ICP have remained stable and\ndrainage was minimal EVD was clamped.   CT scan showed no\nevidence of hydrocephalus, EVD was removed on .  She had an\nevaluation for PEG placement on . She underwent successful\nPEG placement at bedside on  and was cleared for transfer to\nthe step down unit.\nShe remained in stepdown unit and remained neurologically\nstable.  On , pt developed subgaleal effusion in the right\nfrontal region.  Repeat HCT demonstrated right frontal subgaleal\neffusion but no evidence of hydrocephalus. She was seen by\nspeech and swallow who cleared her for an oral diet of soft\nsolids and thin liquids. She remained stable on the floor while\nawaiting dispo on  and on  she was deemed to not be\ntaken adequate oral PO's so her tube feeds were restarted via\nher PEG.  She was awaiting dispo on  and her exam was\nstable.\n\nOn  she passed her speech and swallow evaluation and her diet\nwas advanced to a regular diet.  Her tube feeds were started on\na night time cycle per nutrition to encourage oral intake during\nthe day.  She was doing extremely well with a passe muir\nspeaking valve and was able to manage her secretions and so on\n respiratory was called for a red cap trial on the trach.\nThe trial was successful and respiratory removed the tracheotomy\ntube.\n\nShe had screening LENIS on .

Continued folate, thiamine, MVI. Received\nsignificant valium in MICU, then tapered off on floor. CIWA\nscales <10 x 48 hours and discontinued. The patient was\nintermittently agitated on the floor demanding to leave\nrequiring code , haldol prn, and 1:1 sitter. Psych was\nconsulted and deemed him not competent to care for self (see\ndispo below).\n.\n# C-spine fracture: s/p fall from sitting while intoxicated.\nOsteophyte fracture discovered at C3/4 level. Also with\nligamentous injury but no obvious tear. Neurosurgery consulted\nand recommended Aspen C-collar at all times x 6 weeks and follow\nup with Dr.  in 6 weeks for evaluation and repeat CT\nc-spine (call  for appointment) Neurosurgery will\ncontact the pt. at the pine street shelter to schedule an\nappointment. The patient continually attempted to remove\nC-collar and required constant redirection as he did not recall\nthat he had a cervical fracture (see memory loss below).\nPsychiatry consultation obtained to determine capacity for\nrefusing collar. It was determined he lacked capacity for this\ndecision. Initially the decision was that we would proceed to\nguardianship, but given that there is no practical way to force\nhim to wear the collar even with guardianship short of 4-point\nrestraints and sedation for 6 weeks, we consulted legal\nservices. There was consensus that although this is an unstable\nlesion, that there is nothing to do to force him to wear it, and\nthat we would send him to a shelter with the collar and\nreiteration to the patient as well as contacting the shelter\nstaff about wearing the collar.\n.\n#cervical collar: We strongly stressed to Mr.  that he must\nwear the cervical collar for 6 weeks at all times. We have\nexplained to him the seriousness of his injury and the fact that\nhe could suffer from serious spinal cord injury if he does not\nwear the collar, the patient was agreable to wearing the collar\non discharge.\n.\n# Nasal fractures, left orbital floor fracture: Plastics and ENT\nconsulted in MICU. s/p closed reduction of nasal fracture and\nnasal packing (Dr. . Unclear initially if orbital\nfracture new or old (if old then deemed non-operative), but\nafter limited movement noted on reduction, plastics team\nbelieved that these fracutres were likely old. Nasal packing\nremoved on . There was no evidence of eye entrapment on ENT\nevaluation. The patient received 5 days clindamycin per ENT due\nto nasal manipulation.\n.\n# Memory loss: Likely due to chronic EtOH abuse, however\ntraumatic brain injury possibly contributing. Baseline appears\nto be A&Ox2 per  records obtained, and notes signify planned\noutpatient w/u for dementia. Despite continued reminders, the\npatient did not remember that he sustained C-spine fracture.\nNeuropsych testing recommended in 6 weeks once acute issues\nresolved.\n.\n# Anemia: Microcytic. Unknown baseline HCT. Iron studies c/w\niron-deficiency and he was started on iron supplements. Hct\nremained stable in the mid-30s during hospital stay. No prior\ncolonoscopy. The patient will need further GI work-up.\n.\n# Nausea: Unclear cause. No associated abdominal pain, vomiting,\nor diarrhea. LFTs, amylase, lipase without specific\nabnormalities. Resolved spontaneously and was tolerating POs at\ndischarge.\n.\n# Peripheral neuropathy: Patient c/o pain bilat foot pain.\nNeuropathy likely EtOH-related. He was given Tylenol 500mg q6h\nand started on gabapentin 300mg tid trial with subjective\nimprovement, but pt. is still complaining of foot pain.\nTherefore, it is unclear if this is really neuropathy, we did\nnot discharge the pt. with neurontin.\n.\n# h/o seizure disorder: Per  records. Unclear etiology (?EtOH\nrelated). Never been on medications.\n.\n# Low grade fever, cough: Concern for respiratory infection,\nespecially aspiration given EtOH abuse, somnolence, recent\nintubation. Lung exam with coarse breath sounds throughout. CXR\nwithout acute process and U/A negative. Cough resolved and\nremained afebrile.\n.\n# Hypernatremia: Likely due to poor access to free water,\nresolved with hydration.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "# Encephalitis/meningitis: Severe cerebral edema on CT head. LP\nwas performed by IR that showed with 7000 WBCs, 1000RBCS protein\n645, glucose 34. Opening pressure was 37 and bolt was placed\nwith initial ICP 25. Patient required mannitol and hypertonic\nsalien with improvement to 13. The following day ICPs were\nstable around 10 and the ICU team stopped hypertonic saline and\nmanatol. Etiology felt to be likely bacterial meninigitis but\nCSF did not grow bacteria because patient was started on\nantibiotics prior to fluid collection. Patient received 2 week\ncourse of vanco/cefepime/ampicillin. Bolt was placed by\nneurosurgery to decompress on admission, which was removed on\n. On  patient was found to be seizing on EEG and\ndilantin was started with a bolus followed by standing Q8 hour\ndosing. Plan for patient to continue dilantin until she can\nfollow up with neurology as an outpatient. The patient had\npersistent fevers which were felt to be due to VAP and dvt (see\nbelow). CT spine and head were performed to rule out absess\nwhich were negative, and patient as afebrile prior to transfer\nto the medicine floor.\n\n# Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for hypoxia intially\nand weaning was somewhat limited by depressed mental status and\nhigh peep requirements due to the patients body habitus. Also\ncomplicated by VAP which was treated with an 8 day course (see\nbelow). Patient was eventually extubated on  with 2 hour\ntransition to CPAP prior to tolerating 2 L of oxygen later that\nday. Towards the end of her ICU admission she was diuresed well\nwith intermittent doses of Lasix 20mg IV.  She continued to\nautodiurese after this likely back down to her baseline volume\nstatus. Once on the medicine floor, she easily transitioned to\nroom air.  She no longer has an oxygen requirement is has an\noxygen saturation of 96-98% on room air.\n\n# RUQ pain/pancreatitis: Patient had intermittent abdominal pain\non the ventilator with mildly elevated lipase. Ultrasound was a\npoor study, and patient had mildly elevated lipase. Pain\nimproved when patient was extubated and she told the MICU team\nthat pain was only related to coughing fits and likely MSK in\nnature.  Pain has completely resolved and the patient is\ntolerating a regular diet.\n\n# VAP: On , new bilateral consolidations were noted on CXR\nand GNRs in the sputum. Patient was initially managed on\nceftriaxone which was increased to cefepime for a total of 8\ndays of vanco/cefepime for VAP treatment ending on .\n\n# DVT: During fever workup, LENI was positive for LLE dvt.\nPatient was initially started on heparin drip followed by\ncoumadin. Because this was presumed to be a provoked dvt, a\nhypercoagulable workup was not pursued.  Her INR was found to be\nsupratherapeutic, and her coumadin has been held for 3 days.  As\nantibiotics are being discontinued on , a rapid drop in\nPT/INR may be noted.  Patient will need to have coumadin\nrestarted at extended care facility with a goal INR of .\nShe will likely require anticoagulation for 3-6 months.\n\n#Elevated cardiac enzymes: On admission, cardiac enzymes were\nmildly elevated. There were no st elevations on EKG. Most likely\ndemand in the setting of sepsis. An echocardiogram was completed\nthat showed marked systolic heart failure with an estimated LV\nEF of 20-30%.  While in hospital, she was started on aspirin 81\nmg, Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily, and her home atenolol was\ntransitioned to metoprolol\n25 mg PO BID.\n\n#Anemia: Patient was found to have hematocrit on presentation of\n37.6 that drifted down to a nadir of 25.3 and currently is 29.4.\n Iron studies were completed and she appears to have iron\ndeficiency anemia.  She was restarted on her home dose of iron\nand added ascorbic acid to increase absorption.\n\n#Weakness: After extubation, patient complained of generalized\nweakness.  This is likely due to her long hospitalization and\ndeconditioning.  She worked with physical therapy in hospital,\nand will require aggressive physical therapy at her rehab\nfacility.",

The left ventricular cavity size is\ntop normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical\nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully\nexcluded. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis\n(LVEF = 20-30 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right\nventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall\ncontractility. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The\nnumber of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic\nvalve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic\npressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\n==============\nNeurology\n==============\nEEG This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and\ndisorganization of the background rhythm with periods of\nsemi-rhythmic\ngeneralized moderate to high voltage theta/delta activity at\ntimes\nconcerning for sharp and slow wave activity. These findings\nsuggest a\nmoderate to severe encephalopathy with underlying cortical\nirritability.\nMedications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are\ncommon\ncauses. Although no electrographic seizures were seen during\nthis\nrecording, the rhythmic theta/delta activity is concerning for\npossible\ndevelopment of seizure activity and would recommend continuous\nvideo EEG\nmonitoring for further characterization and evaluation. Note is\nmade of\nan irregular rhythm with frequent PVCs.\n\nEEG This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine\nsampling showed primarily an encephalopathic background but with\nmany\ngeneralized frontally predominent sharp wave epileptiform\ndischarges.\nThese were seen in isolation rather than reptitively or in an\nelectrographic seizure. A single suspicious event occured at\n13:00 on\nthe afternoon of . This showed a sudden appearance of\nalpha\nfrequency activity primarily in the right central parietal area\nbut with\nspread to the left frontal region and with an increase in\nfrequency over\n30 seconds. By video, this was associated with apparent\nhyperventilation. This raises the possibility of a single\nseizure.\nOtherwise, there were frequent epileptiform sharp wave\ndischarges but no\nclear seizures.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Pt. was a transfer from St.  Hospital in , NH via\nEMS.  As noted above, Mr.  was brought into the trauma\nbay by EMS with a number of notable orthopaedic injuries.  He\nwas AOx3 at the time and hemodynamically stable.  After initial\nstabilization, he was taken to radiology for further\ninvestigation of his injuries.  Pertinent films are listed\nabove.  His treatment, organized by problems, consisted of:\n\n#SAH-->  Pt was noted to have a small-moderate Subarachnoid\nhemmorhage with a normal neurological exam.  Neurosurgery was\nemergently consulted, and the patient was loaded with IV\ndilantin and continued on a stable PO regimen of this\nmedication.  Serial examinations were normal, and a repeat CT\nshowed no worsening of his hemmorhage.  After a 10 day course\nhis Dilantin was discontinued.  He has had no further\nneurological events.\n\n#Leg--> Pt. had comminuted fractures in his L LE, treated via\nORIF of femur, tib as noted above.  Pt. had no complications of\nthis surgery, and has been improving with PT in the post-op\nperiod.\n\n#Shoulder--> Pt initially maintained on a sling for comfort.\nEventually on  he was taken to the OR for repair of his\naforementioned shoulder injuries.  Please see the detailed op\nnote for full proceding of this operation.  He had no post-op\ncomplications and has been participating with PT.  He is\nmaintained in a abduction sling currently, and will need ortho\nf/u as indicated in his discharge paperwork.\n\n#Facial Fractures-->  The pt. was seen emergently by plastic\nsurgery in response to his multiple facial fractures.  He was\ninitially maintained on sinus precautions and amoxicilln.  On\n he was taken to the OR for repair, as described above.  He\nwas treated with post-op augmentin and has completed that\ncourse.  He will f/u with plastics as described.  Ophthalmology\nsaw the patient before his operation, and cleared him from the\nstandpoint of intra-ocular lesions.\n\n#Pysch-->  Psych has followed the patient in house.  At no time\nwas he section 12 or suffering from suicidal or homicidal\nideation.  He has had no behavioural problems while in house.\nPsychiatry felt that his psychosis was stable; it required no\nfurther medications, and he required no specialized psychiatric\nhospitalization.  He did well in a shared room on an open floor.\n A number of labs were sent, including folate, b12, tsh; all of\nthese were normal.  Please see his psychiatric and social work\nnotes for extensive details of his history.  he will need local\npsych f/u in NH.\n\n#FEN--> at time of discharge patient is able to tolerate a PO\ndiet without difficulty; he is taking a diabetic diet and has\nrecieved diabetic teaching from the nutritionist.\n\n#DM--->  was involved in his DM care.  He was initially\nstarted on a SS regimen, but this had to be increased twice due\nto continually high FSG.  He was started on Metformin on ,\nand his FSG began to decrease.   suggested that his\nsliding scale insulin be decreased and possibly discontinued at\nrehab, as his metformin will take a week for full effect to be\nrealized.\n\nHe was discharged from  today with his vital signs within\nnormal limits and he will follow up as previously described.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "89 year old female with dCHF, HTN and severe asthma requiring\nrecurrent ED visits currently on prednisone taper, transferred\nfrom OSH with respiratory distress intubated for airway\nprotection and ECG changes now s/p clean cardiac\ncatheterization.\n\n#. Respiratory distress: Patient has had recurrent exacerbations\nof COPD vs asthma requiring repeated treatment with steroids.\nShe carries diagnosis of asthma and smoked 1 pack per week in\npast and has been on spiriva. She improved rapidly with steroids\nIV which were transitioned to oral. There was no documentation\nof hypercapnia or hypoxia prior to intubation so unclear if she\nactually had respiratory failure or was just intubated for\nairway protection given ECG changes. Wheezing and air movement\nimproved with nebulizers and steroids and she extubated without\ndifficulty on . Given elevated BP requiring nitro gtt prior\nto intubation, may have had some component of flash pulmonary\nedema as well but CXR was clear without evidence of volume\noverload or pneumonia. She was also given lasix 40 IV x 1 and\nthen 20 PO x 1 for some mild component of volume overlaod but\nwas satting well on room air prior to trasnfer to floor.  She is\nbeing discharged on a prednisone taper as well as standing\nnebulizer treatments.\n\n#. ECG changes/Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy: ECG with ST\nelevations in V2-6 and positive troponins which peaked at 0.58\nthen trended down. Cardiology was consulted and Code STEMI was\ncalled on arrival to the MICU and she was taken for cardiac\ncatheteterization. She was also initially started on heparin gtt\nand integrillin drip. There were no flow limiting lesions so\nheparin and integrillin stopped. ECG changes and positive\ntroponin felt to be due to Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. She was\nstarted on ASA 325 daily, metoprolol, and an ACE-inhibitor.  She\nshould have an repeat TTE in  weeks.\n\n#. HTN: Was initially hypertensive on nitro gtt prior to\ntrasnfer which was quickly weaned off in ED and BP remained\nimproved and normalized back on home regimen HCTZ, Imdur and\namlodipine. She was also started on an ACE-inhibitor and beta\nblocker, which can be uptitrated after discharge as needed.\n\n#. Chronic diastolic CHF: Known diastolic dysfunction with EF\n>55% in the past and EF now depressed 40% on LV gram done in\ncath lab but repeat formal TTE with improved EF. BB and ACE were\nstarted.\n\n#. : Cr 1.7 from baseline 1.2-1.3 which improved slightly\nwith gentle diuresis. FEurea 34%. It was felt that her renal\nfunction was likely worsened by dye load but stable at time of\ntransfer. She was given NAC after her contrast load.\n\n#. Hyperkalemia: K 6.8 increased from 5.4 on admission. Possibly\nrelated to worsening renal function vs acidemia from progressive\nhypercarbia. Improved with insulin/D50, lasix, bicarb and\ncalcium gluconate.\n\n#. Anemia: Hematocrit remained at baseline 32.\n\n#. Delirium: Was combative and agitated  post-extubation\nwhich responded well to 2mg IM haldol and she was alert oriented\nand cooperative at time of floor transfer and subsequently\nthereafter.\n\n#.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "On arrival at  from the OSH, the patient's enzymes were\ntrop T 0.06 and 0.11, she went for cath and was found to have a\nsignificant lesion in her RCA. The lesion was stented open with\na drug-eluting stent, but during the procedure the patient\nreported feeling itchy and then her BP plummetted with cold and\nclammy extremities. She was presumed to have anaphylactic shock,\nwas intubated for airway protection and was started on pressors\n(Neo and Epi) with little effect. An IABP was then placed to\nincrease perfusion of the pt's coronaries as well as forward\nflow.  Echo in cath (while on pressors): small LV cavity, EF\n>75%, hyperdynamic LV,  mild resting LV outflow tract\nobstruction, no effusion.  The patient came to the CCU in this\nstate.\n\nIn the CCU it was noted that the patient was having an acidemia,\nso she was repleted with HCO3 containing IVF. She was weaned off\nthe pressors, first Epi and then Neo, then she was weaned off\nthe IABP, and finally she was extubated without complications.\nRepeat echo in CCU: Suboptimal study; LVEF 50%; HK of the basal\nanterior wall; comparison to previous study difficult.\n\nThe patient went to the floor and remained stable on the floor.\n\n1. Anaphylaxis\nAs noted, pt had reaction to contrast dye during cath, required\nNeo and Epi for HOTN. Pt was initially given Solumedrol 60mg IV\nTID, then tapered gradually and swithched to PO prednisone once\ntolerating PO. Pt was on Prednisone 30mg qd x 3d in hospital,\nwill d/c on 20mg po qd x 3d, then back to her pre-hospital\ncourse of 10mg po qd.  Pt was also on Benadryl initially which\nwas switched to PRN after 2d but never required after that point\nwith no further signs of allergic reaction; she was on an H2\nblocker (pepcid) initially, which was eventually d/c'd in the\nsetting of low plts and concern that this could be related.\n\n2. CV\na)CAD: pt never officially ruled in for MI by EKG or enzymes\n(Trop T from admit onward: .05 .11 .09 .04 .07 .09), (CPK from\nadmit onward: 90 60 84 34 45 68 79); given trending up Troponin\non admit and continuing pain, pt was brought to cath lab where\nit was found that: LMCA -- no CAD; LAD -- mid vessel 60%\nstenosis; LCx -- no CAD; RCA -- focal 95% stenosis in distal\nportion; the distal RCA lesion was considered the likely cause\nof the patient's symptoms and was stented open with a Cypher\nDES. Continued , , Lipitor while in house.\n\nOn PM of  pt was noted to have  SSCP of similar quality\nto admission CP, EKG without changes and cardiac enzymes flat.\nNo relief with SLNTG, Maalox, Lopressor; relief with morphine.\nThough to be unlikely cardiac in origin, possibly from ET tube.\nPrescribed Tylenol QID prn for pain control.\n\nb)Pump: echo in cath lab -- EF >75%, hyperdynamic LV; was\ninitially tachycardic with low BP and low CO, likely secondary\nto low intravascular fluid volume in setting of extravasation of\nfluid from leaky capillaries in anaphylaxis; pt responded to\nfluids and steroids, was weaned off IABP and pressors over 2d of\nbeing in the CCU.  Repeat echo off pressors showed LVEF 50% with\nHK of the basal anterior wall, comparison difficult given poor\nstudy however; pt was on metoprolol 50mg po tid, Captopril\n12.5mg tid. BP rose into the systolic 180s 3d post cath, likely\nfrom mobilization of fluid back into the patient's vasculature\nfrom the 3rd-spacing she had from anaphylaxis. Her urine output\nincreased substantially at this time as well, consistent with\nthe diagnosis of volume overload.  She was started on HCTZ on\nd/c, as well as atenolol and increased doses of metoprolol.\n\nc)Rhythm: AFib w/ V-pacer; cont metoprolol for rate control;\nafter discussing with pt's PCP,  was determined that the\npatient is not a good candidate for long term anticoagulation\nfor her PAF with coumadin, given her h/o falls\n\n3. Pulm: pt had hypoxic respiratory failure 2nd to anaphylaxis,\nwas intubated for 2d in the CCU but responded well to steroids,\nhad no difficulties in weaning her from the vent to shovel mask\nand then to NC and finally to RA; continued flovent, albuterol,\nipratropium, prednisoe for COPD\n\n4. Heme: pt had low platelets and hct during her CCU course; was\ngiven 1 unit PRBC for hct of 26.4 with bump to 29.6; platelets\nstabilized though heparin and pepcid were held to make sure this\nwas not a reaction. Likely plt dropped from blood transfusion.\nPt also noted to be B12 deficient, started on repletion regimen;\nalso iron deficient, will replete and pt may need outpatient\ncolonoscopy.\n\n4. Endo: osteoporosis - con't fosamax\n\n5. PPx: maintained on Protonix; discussed restarting heparin\nand/or coumadin for PAF\n\n6. Dispo: PT consult indicating need for short term rehab\n\n7.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "HOSPITAL COURSE:\nMr.  is a pleasant 78 M with DM2, HTN, HL presents after\nfall with LOC and found to have probably NSTEMI, ICH, and atrial\nflutter. Pt was intubated briefly for airway protection and\nextubated without event. Evaluated by cardiology who recommended\nMetoprolol, but given risks of ICH, held off on antiplatelet\nmedications. Neurology evaluated and recommended holding on\nAspirin for 7 days. Pt monitored closely and had no neurologic\nchange.  81mg was started on . Evaluated by PT and OT.\nCleared by OT cognitively, and PT recommended acute rehab given\nunsteady gait and far from baseline.\n.\n# Syncope, FALL: Likely due to ACS vs atrial flutter in setting\nof known mild-moderate aortic stenosis. Biomarkers peaked .\nPer discussion with PT, pt not cleared to home with PT, as far\nfrom baseline and unsteady on feet. Pt discharged to acute\nrehab.\n.\n#. Atrial Flutter with RVR: Started after admission but patient\nwas largely asymptomatic and may have had this as an outpatient\nas above. Initially started on dilt gtt, and metoprolol IV.\nTitrated both to orals. Pt converted to sinus rhythm morning of\ntransfer to floors. No systemic anticoagulation given ICH. Dilt\ndiscontinued on  given sinus bradycardia to mid 50s.\nSwitched to Toprol XL 150mg daily from 200 initially given\nbradycardia. Pt was in sinus rhythm on discharge. On aspirin\n81mg for stroke prophylaxis.\n\n#. ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: Pt had troponin leak with ST\ndepressions in inferolateral leads. Biomarkers peaked , with\nCK 1318. As discussed in ICU, given CNS bleed, plan was to start\n 7 days after admission. Echo demonstrates EF 50% 2/2\ninferior posterior hypokinesis/akinesis which is new from TTE of\n compared to OSH records. Cardiology and Neurology\nevaluation during MICU stay, with decision to hold on\ndiagnostic/therapeutic cardiac catheterization given inability\nto anticoagulate or start /clopidogrel. Was started on\nmetoprolol and atorvastatin. Cardiology was re-consulted on the\nfloors and recommended  81mg daily, but no indication for\nstarting plavix. Pt was started on  81mg on , as he was 8\ndays out from ICH. At time of discharge, pt feeling well without\nany chest pain, SOB, or palpitations. He will follow-up with his\ncardiologist to discuss further evaluation for ischemia.\n\n#. INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE: Found to have pontine hemorrhage\nconfirmed on imaging here. Neurology evaluated and recommended\nholding antiplatelet medication.  held for 7 days and then\nstarted per neuro recs. Pt had no residual deficits and was\ndischarged with neurology follow-up.\n.\n# Aspiration pneumonia: Thick secretions after extubation\nconcerning for aspiration PNA. Pt treated with renally dosed\nLevofloxacin and completed course. Cough improved and remained\nafebrile.\n.\n#. Stage III CKD: Baseline 1.8-2.0 per OSH records. Remained\nstable during this admission, with Cr 1.8 on discharge.\n.\n# Anemia: Normocytic, thought to be multifactorial  ACD given\nDiabetes, traumatic intubation and possible iron deficiency. No\nsigns or symptoms of bleeding during the admission, though pt\nreportedly had traumatic intubation at OSH with reported guaiac\npositive. Iron studies suggest Fe def anemia. Stool was dark\nbrown and guaiac negative here. However, Pt reported history of\ngastric ulcer, and was started on Omeprazole given new aspirin\nindication. Pt instructed to follow-up with PCP for further\nmanagement with consideration of future studies, including\ncolonoscopy, endoscopy, etc.\n.\n#. DIABETES TYPE II: Per sons, had recently been\nexercising/walking to improve his glucose control and get off of\ninsulin, which he was able to do a few months ago. Placed on ISS\nwhile in-house. Discharged on Glipizide 5 mg extended release\ngiven renal failure and concern for hypoglycemic episodes\nreported by pt at home on renally-cleared glyburide.. Instructed\nto check BG frequently on discharge. Instructed to follow-up\nwith Endocrinologist and PCP for close management.\n.\n# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Increased atorvastatin to 80 mg daily given\npossible acute coronary syndrome.\n.\n# HTN: On lisinopril at home (40mg daily), which was held\ninitially given concern for hypotension in setting of starting\nrate controlling agents for aflutter as above. Lisinopril 5mg\ndaily started when transferred to medical floors. As above, also\nstarted on Toprol XL as above. Normotensive on discharge.\n.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Pt brought emergently to the operating room from the emergency\ndepartment and underwent a right sided craniectomy. Surgery was\nwithout complication. She was transfered post operatively to the\ntrauma ICU for close neurological monitoring.\nPost op Head CT revealed an interval decrease in midline shift\nbut increased cerebral edema and herniation of brain tissue\noutside of craniectomy site. A subdural drain was placed intraop\nand maintained.  Plastics, ENT, and Opthamology were consulted\nand care recommendations were made regarding facial fractures, R\norbital injury, and R ear CSF leak/laceration.\n\n exam showed no eye opening, R pupil fixed and dilated, L\npupil 3mm and fixed, BUE extending, BLE triple flexion. On an MRI Brain and C/T/L spine was obtained to further assess\ngiven the patient's exam. Brain MRI showed diffuse axonal\ninjury.  Total spine MRI demonstrated no vertebral fractures or\nsignal changes within the spinal cord. On  the subdural\ndrain was discontinued.\n\nThe patient was managed on hypertonic Saline drip with a goal\nserum Na of 150.  The drip was held on  for Na greater\nthan 150 and was restarted on  for Na of 142.  Repeat head CT\nfrom  showed interval increase in herniation through the\nright craniectomy site and 4mm rightward shift of midline\nstructures.  Pt's exam remained grossly unchanged although when\nthe fentanyl wean was attempted she did exhibit move movement of\nher extremities to stimulation but her movements did not appear\npursposeful.  During a fentanyl wean she became hemodynamically\nunstable with hypertension and tachycardia.  However she did not\nrespond to fentanyl boluses and it was not clear that her\nhemodynamic instability was due to fentanyl withdrawal.  EEG\ncontinuous 24hr monitoring was initiated to rule out seizure as\na cause of her instability.\n\nShe stabilized , her hypertonic Saline was decreased to\n30cc/hr. The beta transferrin was NEGATIVE for CSF on her R ear.\nOn  her hypertonic saline was decreased to 20cc/hr and then\ndiscontinued on . Her serum Sodiums remained stable after her\nhypertonic saline is off. On  she went to the OR with OMFS\nfor open reduction with internal fixation of her right\nmandibular body fracture and had her trach/PEG placed.\nPost-operatively she remained stable. She was weaned to a trach\nmask on  with good results.  A head CT was done on the\nmornign of  which showed increase in the extracranial\nherniation of brain tissue as well as external hydrocephalus.\nAs a result Dr  took her to the Operating Room for\nplacement of a left sided VP shunt and the shunt was set at 0.5.\n She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU\nafter the surgery. Her exam improved post-operatively as she was\nspontaneously moving her upper extremities as well as to\nnoxious.\n\nOn  her CT of the head showed that she had developed external\nhydrocephalus and midline shift and a small left sided subdural\nfluid collection. She was taken to the Operating room for\nplacement of VPS on the left.\n\nOn  She remained clinically stable, she continues to have\nfevers and is being treated with Vanc and nafcillin. GPC/GNR\nfound in sputum.\n\nOn , patient had a head CT which showed hydrocephalus and\nshunt was reprogrammed to 0.5 from 2. Repeat head CT on showed decrease in ventricular size.\n\nOn , patient had bilious emesis, g-tube was placed to\ngravity and had significant output. KUB was done which did not\nshow obstruction. On , stool like material in g-tube,\ngeneral surgery was consulted. A CXR was also done to rule out\naspiration. No infectious process was seen on x-ray. A repeat\nhead CT was stable from previous study on the 12th.\n\nGeneral surgery recommendations were to keep g-tube at gravity\nfor a day or two and restart tube feeds in AM at very slow rate\nand then increase. No need for further imaging due to decreasing\noutput from g-tube. The tube feeds were restarted slowly on\n, which patient tolerated.\n\nOn  a LUE twitch was noted but remained self limited. On\n her sutures/staples were removed.\n\nOn  a head CT and EEG was ordered as she continued to have a\nLUE twitch. The head CT showed a worsening subdural collection\nOn  EEG was started. She remained stable. No overt seizures\nwere noted. On  a repeat head CT was improved. Trach ties\nwere removed on .\n\nShe remained stable and was discharged to rehab on .",

The goal of\ndiuresis for each day was approximately 500cc-1L per day.\n.\nThere was also a suspected right lower lobe pneumonia that was\ntreated with levofloxacin for a 1 week duration (renal dosage).\nSputum and blood cultures were negative.\n.\nAspiration Risk: Evidently a chronic issue, thought to be due to\nworsening decline of Parkinson's Disease as well as fluctuating\nmental status. Speech and swallow had evaluted patient and\ndeemed him unable to take anything by mouth, and pt was kept NPO\nuntil family and patient could agree upon next step in\nmanagement, with guidance from medical team. Lengthy family\ndiscussion occurred while hospitalized to discuss feeding\noptions, including a repeat video swallow vs. a temporary NG\ntube. Pt and family ultimately decided for him to undergo repeat\nvideo swallow study which he passed, and the following\nrecommendations were made: moist, ground solids, nektar\nthickened liquids, pills crushed with applesauce, and sips of\nthin liquids in between meals. If he is choking/coughing on the\nthin liquids, this should be discontinued. Patient should\ncontinue to be monitored by speech and swallow back at rehab. He\nis still a known chronic aspirator despite the results of video\nspeech and swallow, and goals of care for nutrition should\ncontinue to be addressed at rehab.\n.\nMetastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: thought to be due\nto cholangiocarcinoma. Pt is not a candidate for any\nchemotherapy due to multiple comorbidities and acute medical\nissues. Family still wants aggressive treatment. Palliative care\nwas involved.\n.\nDysphagia: Was evaluated on last admission by speech and swallow\nteam as well. Due to chronic medical issues and worsening of\nparkinson's disease, patient's ability to swallow worsened\nduring admission. He was unable to tolerate thickened liquids,\nand was ultimately sent for repeat video swallow analysis as per\nabove.\n.\nHypertension: Was controlled with hydralazine and isosorbide,\nwith a goal SBP of 130-140 range. Aggressive BP lowering was\navoided.\n.\nDuring this admission, pt also developed constipation, which was\ntreated with senna, colace, dulculax, and finally enema.\n.\nCoronary artery disease: history of NSTEMI. Troponin mildly\nelevated on admission, likely  demand in setting of\nhypertensive urgency. Patient was given aspiring, beta blockers,\nimdur, statin, and diuresis.\n.\nChronic renal insufficency: patient maintained a stable\ncreatinine level that was close to baseline despite aggressive\ndiuresis.\n.\nProphylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, aggressive bowel regimen,\nhome PPI\n.\nAccess: PICC, PIV x2\n.\nCode: full\n.\nCommunication: Patient, wife and daughter",

Patient volume\noverloaded on exam with elevated BNP.  He was diuresed for acute\non chronic systolic heart failure with lasix gtt.  An echo was\ndone that showed dilated LA, RA, RV and LV; LV systolic function\ndepressed with EF 20-25%.  His outpatient cardiologist was\ncontact who confirmed that patient was on diovan, aldactone,\nand coumadin as an outpatient.  Ultimately, his lasix gtt was\nswitched to torsemide.  Valsartan was and metoprolol were\nrestarted.  EP was also consulted for possible biv upgrade of\npatient's ICD as he was 90% RV pacing with widened QRS.\nPatient's ICD was interogated and revealed underlying sinus\nrhythm with 1:1 AV conduction.  His ICD was reprogrammed to\nallow native conduction.  Patient was discharged with plans for\nfollow up with EP as an outpatient.\n.\n#. Atrial Fibrillation: Confirmed with outpatient cardiologist\nthat patient had been on coumadin and was in favor of restarting\nthis.  Patient wsa restarted on coumadin with lovenox bridge.\nAmiodarone was continued.  EP consulted as stated above, pacer\ninterrogated showing underlying sinus with 1:1 AV conduction.\n.\n#Hypotention: No infectious etiology identified.  Patient\ndiuresed cautiously; sbp ranged from 70s-110s but mentating\nwell.  His  and beta blocker were started slowly as blood\npressure tolerated.\n.\n# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Creatine improved with\ndiuresis; diovan restarted later on his hospital course.\n.\n# Elevated LFTs: Improved with diuresis, likely hepatic\ncongestion secondary to acute on chronic heart failure.\n.\n#. CAD: Patient was continued on aspirin, zocor, and /bb were\nrestarted at later date. Plavix was stopped as patient was over\na year out from his catheterization.\n.\n# Diabetes: Continued NPH and sliding scale.\n.\n#Hyperlipidemia: continued zocor and tricor\n.\n#STAGE II HEEL/DECUBITUS: wound care consulted.

Please\nsee operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he\nwas transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated in critical\nbut stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from\nsedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He weaned\noff pressor support and Beta-blocker/aspirin/statin and diuresis\nwere initiated. He was transfused with blood products\npostoperatively for coagulopathy and anemia likely due to blood\nloss and volume resucitation. POD#1 A right pneumothorax was\nevident on CXR. A thoracosotomy tube was inserted and remained\nin until pneumothorax resolved. All tubes and drains were\ndiscontinued per protocol. Anticoagulation was resumed for his\nchronic atrial fibrillation. He remained in CVICU until POD#3\nfor aggressive pulmonary hygiene. He was slow to progress but\ntransferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.\nPhysical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and\nmobility.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "# Sepsis -  After arrival to  ED from  Hospital, patient became obtunded and was intubated. He had a\nfever and became hypotensive, and was maintained on Levophed and\nDopamine.  Vancomycin and Zosyn were started for broad coverage,\nand he was admitted to the ICU. Within 1 day, he was extubated,\nweaned off pressors, and his mental status improved. Upon\ntransfer to floor, he was afebrile and alert to person and\nplace, but not year.  Potential sources of sepsis included\nsacral decubitus wound (culture grew moderate enterococcus), PNA\n(CXR not definitive, sputum gram stain with sparse staph\naureus), or UTI (cultures have only grown yeast).  He will\ncomplete a 10 day total course of IV vanc and zosyn.\n.\n#Hypoxia - Patient is on home oxygen per report.  Oxygen\nrequirement in house likely from combination of volume and\npossible PNA.  It has improved after his ICU transfer.  He\nreceived IV diuresis and was continued on antibiotics.  His\noxygen can continue to be weaned as he tolerates at rehab.\n.\n# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: In , right frontal SAH was\ndiscovered after new onset left arm weakness.  Head CT read at\nOSH prior to this admission describes new head bleed, however\nthe images were reviewed at the  and repeat head CT showed\nno new bleed. Prior bleed is stable.  Neurosurgery saw the\npaitent and recommends medical management. Patient was continued\non Dilantin.  He will follow up in NSG in 1 month with a repeat\nhead CT.\n.\n# CAD / NSTEMI - Patient developed a cardiac enzyme leak on the\nday of ICU admission.  There were no EKG findings of acute\nischemia. Enzyme leak was thought to be related to demand in the\nsetting of sepsis. Enzymes have trended down. EKG and ECHO\nfindings seemed consistent with old inferior MI but not acute\nprocess. Aspirin and Heparin were held due to history of\nintracranial hemorrhage. Statin was continued. Beta Blocker was\nrestarted once pressure became stable and titrated to 25 .\nThis may be blood pressure limited and may need to be titrated\nback down to 12.5 .  Please add an ace-inhibitor in the\nfuture when blood pressure allows given he has left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction.\n.\n# AFib - Patient has ICD and is on Amiodarone. Amiodarone was\ncontinued. He was restarted on BB as his pressures tolerated\n.\n# Decubitus ulcers: Small erythema noted on right heal.  Also\nlarger pressure ulcer on sacrum.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I,\nhypothyroidism, gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic\nrespiratory failure.\n.\n1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure: She arrived intubated and sedated\nfrom  Hospital.  On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar\nand bibasilar opacities, which appeared conistent with pulmonary\nedema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia.  There was\nno evidence of ARDS.  She was known to have gram-positive cocci\nin her sputum at the outside hospital.  A bronchoscopy with BAL\nwas performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA.  She\nwas treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia.\n.\n   A CT scan was performed on  to evaluate the soft tissue\nswelling seen on CT at the outside hospital.  The CT showed\nincreased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be\nsecondary to prolonged intubation/trauma.  She was treated with\nsteroids for this swelling at the outside hospital, and these\nwere continued.  It was decided that patient should receive one\nmore trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy.\nShe did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to\ndelay extubating the patient until the morning of .\nOvernight, the patient became hypoxic, dropping to the 80's.  A\nchest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high\nin the trachea.  The cuff was deflated and the patient was\nextubated.  She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask\nand her sats immediately improved.  She was weaned down until\nshe was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by\nnasal cannuala.  As she was doing well without evidence of\nstridor, the steroids were stopped.  She did well and was weaned\nfrom supplemental oxygen.  At the time of discharge, she was\noxygenating well on room air.  She Will need to complete a 14\nday course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on .\n.\n2. Enterobacter bacteremia: She was initially covered broadly\nwith vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and falgyl.  She had positive\nblood cultures at  Hospital for gram negative rods.\nSubsequently, zosyn was added.  The cultures grew out\nenterobacter cloacae.  It was unclear the source of her\nbacteremia.  Her stool cultures were negative.  Her central line\nwas removed and the tip was culture negative.  She was\ntransitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia.  She had no\npositive cultures during this admission.  Once she was more\nstable, an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess.\nThis study was negative.  However, the study was limited due to\ninadequate po contrast intake by the patient; it did show a\nquestion of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel.\nThis study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po's.\n She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her\nbacteremia on .\n.\n3. Diabetes type I: She was intially maintained on an insulin\ndrip for tight glycemic control.  She was followed by during the admission.  She was initially maintained on D5W,\nwhich was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently\nborderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip.   Once she began\nto take PO's, the insulin drip was stopped and patient was\nstarted on glargine with a humalog sliding scale.  While her po\nintake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV\ndextrose to suppress ketosis.  While she was on the IV dextrose,\nshe required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control.\nAs she starting taking some foods, her glargine was decrease.\nAt the time of discharge her glargine was 10.  Her blood glucose\nwere under good control.  The day prior to discharge, she was\nnauseated and not taking pos.  Therefore, she received 1L of D5,\nand her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge.\n.\n4. Gastroparesis: She has a history of gastroparesis secondary\nto long-standing type I diabetes.  Once she was extubated, she\nwas nauseated with emesis.  She was intially treated with\nerythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to\nreglan in the past.  She continued to remained nauseated so she\nwas treated with phenergan, anzemet, zofran, and ativan.  She\nintermittently was able tolerate pos.  Her nausea was\naccompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with\nmorphine.  She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain\ncontrol.  She continued to have nausea despite an agressive\nanti-emetic regimen.  It was felt that her symptoms were\nsecondary to gastroparesis.  However, other causes were looked\nfor including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction.  She\nhad a normal cortisol stimulation test.  A abdominal plain film\nshowed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an\nearly obstruction.  A NG tube was placed for decompression given\nthe signs of early obstruction the day of transfer.  The GI\nservice was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all\ngastroparesis.  They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm.  She\nshould eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out\nceliac disease.\n.\n5. Transaminitis: Per report, She had elevated LFTs at the\noutside hospital.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was\nperformed and was negative for any acute pathology.  Her LFTs\ntrended down during this admission.\n.\n6. Hypothyroidism: She was maintained on her levothyroxine.\nWhile she was not taking adequate pos, she was on IV\nlevothyroxine.\n.\n7. F/E/N: She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings\nfor nutrition. After extubation, patient was started on sips and\nhad a speech and swallow evaluation.  She was cleared to advance\nher diet as tolerated.  She only tolerated some clear liquids.\nAt the time of transfer, she was NPO given her NG tube.\n.\n8. Prophylaxis: PPI, Heparin SQ.\n.\n9. Access: Her central line was removed given the concern for a\nline infection.  She had a double lumen PICC place.\n.\n10. CODE: FULL\n.\n11. Dispo: She was transfered back to  Hospital per the\npatient's and husband's request so that she would be closer to\nhome once her respiratory status was stable.\nanti-GBM is pending.",

He received Cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics\nand transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative\nmanagement.  He required vasopressin, Levophed, and Milrinone\nfor hemodynamic support.  That evening he was weaned from\nsedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without\ncomplications. Electrophysiology was consulted and his permanent\npacemaker was interrogated.  On post operative day one he was\nstarted on Captopril and Milrinone weaned off.  However on post\noperative day two he went into atrial fibrillation, requiring\nAmiodarone, and Milrinone was restarted due to decreased cardiac\noutput.  Mr.  became progressively oliguric and was\nstarted on Lasix. Levophed was again required due to hypotension\nafter Captopril. Inotropes and pressors were titrated for\nhemodynamics, and Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.\n   His renal function continued to worsen requiring increasing\ndoses of Lasix and Zaroxolyn.  On  he was re-intubated for\nhypoxia and pulmonary edema requiring a Lasix drip for diuresis\nin acute renal failure.  He was started on Coumadin and heparin\nfor anticoagulation due to ongoing atrial fibrillation.  On he was cardioverted and returned to sinus rhythm.  That evening\nwas able to wean off Levophed and progressively over next 24\nhours was weaned off epinephrine.  Heparin drip was stopped when\nINR was 2.2 and continued on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.\nAmiodarone drip was converted over to oral Amiodarone.  On he was extubated without complications and continued to remain\nstable on milrinone.  His Lasix was changed from drip to bolus\ndosing.  He remained in the intensive care unit for monitoring\nand remained stable. He was ultimately weaned off inotropes and\na  repeat  was obtained.  His renal function\ncontinued to slowly improve and he was transferred out of the\nintensive care unit on post-operative day 17. He was restarted\non his home dose of oral lasix, 80mg daily.  Although his labs\nhave been stable, his sodium, BUN, and creatinine should be\nclosely monitored at rehab.  He was placed on antibiotics for a\nurinary tract infection for seven days, to end on . Physical\nTherapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.\nHe continued to slowly progress and was cleared for discharge to\n rehab on post-op day 21. All follow up  were\nadvised.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "In summary, Mr  is a 74 y/o M w h/o CAD (s/p CABG), aortic\nregurg (s/p mechanical valve replacement), chronic combined\nsystolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 45%)  ischemic CMP s/p ICD\nplacement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who originally\npresented w fall and was diagnosed with R hip fracture. He was\ntransferred to BIMDC on  for R hip ORIF. His course has\nbeen complicated by post-op bleeding in the setting of required\nanticoagulation for the presence of a mechanical valve. The\nbleeding resulted in a R gluteal hematoma, hypotension (resolved\nwith fluid resuscitation), acute anemia (treated with\ntransfusions), ARF and transaminits (likely  to hypoperfusion\nof kidney/liver).\n.\n#. Hip Fracture / Trauma / Hematoma: Imaging was repeated on\narrival to , which confirmed right hip fracture. Due to\ncomplain of neck pain, CT c-spine was performed and did not\nreveal any concerning findings. Given history of mechanical\naortic valve, anticoagulation with heparin drip was re-initiated\nand cardiology consult was obtained for pre operative\nassessment. Stress test was obtained and revealed fixed deficits\nwithout reversible ischemia. Patient underwent successful hip\narthroplasty on , and heparin drip was restarted 6 hours\npost procedure. While in the ICU, the patient did have a\nnoticeable Hct drop following anticoagulation, but had an\nappropriate Hct bump after being transfused 2UPBRCs. Following\nthis, the patient was transferred to the floor with stable Hct's\nuntil the morning of  when the patient's Hct was noted to\ndrop from 27.3 --> 23.3. In addition to this, the patient's\nblood pressure was lower than usual (baseline SBP in the 90's).\nOn examination, R gluteal hematoma was found and confirmed with\nCT imaging. The pt was transferred back to the MICU and received\ntotal of 4units pRBCs while in MICU. Hct has been stable, thus\nrestarted heparin gtt on .  has been following to\neval for compartment syndrome and wound infection, doing serial\nexams to ensure no foot drop or other concerning findings. On\ndischarge, surgical wound healing well with no complications.\nFollowup with Dr  scheduled.\n.\n#. Fall / Syncope: History was very suggestive of syncopal\nepisode, with prior history of orthostatic hypotension and\nrecent medication change (may have predisposed to medication\nerror). Differential diagnosis however includes non perfusing\narrhythmia, myocardial infarction (leading to arrhytmia), acute\nvalvular disease (although highly unlikely with normal exam),\nmassive pulmonary embolus, and seizure. Patient was ruled out\nfor MI, had a CT with old cerbellar infarct and ECHO without\nsignificant change from prior. ICD was interrogated and no VT/VF\nepisodes had been detected. Fall likely secondary to orthostatic\nhypotension. Nitrates,  (ACE-I allergic) were held, low-dose\nBBl was continued.\n.\n#. Acute anemia: In setting of fracture and extensive hematoma,\nas above, patient responed appropiately to blood transfusions.\n.\n#. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: Appears stable. Given relative\nhypotension on admission, we held antihypertensives with\nexception of metoprolol. We continued aspirin 81mg and statin,\nbut held nitrate,  and spironolactone.\n.\n#. Coronary Artery Disease: Extensive burden of disease,\nalthough patient is currently asymptomatic. pMIBI negative for\nreversible ischemia. Aspirin, atorvastatin and metoprolol\ncontinued.\n.\n# Chronic syst/diast CHF, fluid overload: Pt received copious\namounts of IVFs while hypotensive and became severely volume\noverloaded (dependent edema), which made physical therapy\ndifficult. Pt was started on bumetanide and treated with a dose\nof 2mg PO BID for aggressive diuresis. His heart failure regimen\nmetoprolol 12.5mg PO BID, spironolactone 12.5mg PO daily,\natorvastatin 80mg PO daily were continued. No ACE for now given\nACE allergy/no  given ARF earlier, consider restarting as an\noutpatient. No nitrates for now.\n.\n# Mechanical Aortic Valve: Heparin drip restarted in the MICU,\nafter pt's Hct stabilized. Coumadin restarted very cautiously on\n, however, having trouble increasing INR, so Coumadin\nincreased to 6mg PO daily for now. Needs to be increased to an\nINR goal of 2.5-3.5, with heparin bridge to cover in the interim\nperiod.\n.\n#. Afib: Patient's rate has been controlled with a low dose beta\nblocker and he has not had a significant bp drop from this\neither. We discussed possibly starting Coreg as it would be\nbetter for his cardiac health, however, we deferred this change\nuntil his anti-coagulation and bleeding issues have been further\nresolved. He is currently on heparin. Coumadin was held for\nbleeding issues and surgery, restarted on .\n.\n#. Acute Renal failure: Baseline Cr ~1, pt developed ARF hypoperfusion vs ATN in the setting of hypotension from\nhemorrhage. Peak Cr 2.1, downtrended gradually to baseline of 1.\nARF resolved completely by discharge.\n.\n#. RUQ Pain/Transaminitis: On POD #3, RUQ tenderness on exam in\nthe MICU. LFTs elevated ALT-82, AST-104, ALKPHOS-301 on ,\ndowntrending afterwards, but peaking again ALT=165, AST=137,\nALK=402. Possible shock liver from hypotension from bleeding.\nRUQ U/S showed absent GB (s/p cholecystectomy), no ductal\ndilation/stones. Pt has no abd pain and no tenderness on exam,\nLFTs downtrending on discharge.\n.\n# Delirium/Confusion: After the operation, the pt became\ndisoriented with slowed speech, waxing and  mental status.\nEtiology likely drug related (pt very susceptible to narcotics\nper wife) vs possible ICU delerium. Head CT on , with no evidence of bleed or interval change. All cultures are\nNGTD, unlikely infectious process. Pt's mental status improved\nsince transfer to floor, however, still waxing and . AOx3\non discharge. Recommend avoidance of narcotics/sedative (used\ntramadol prn for pain and haldol prn for hyperactivity or\nagitation).\n.\n# Fever/Leukocytosis: After the surgery, the pt had low grade\ntemps to 99-100. Unlikely PE (pt not tachycardic, on heparin\ndrip, R unilateral LENIs negative), CXR neg for aspiration,\nblood and urine cx's show NGTD. RUQ U/S neg for\ncholedocholithiasis. Patient finished levo/vanc 10 day course on\n. He was also started on keflex for ?cellulitis around\ngroin site. He then spiked a fever on  to 100.5. He was\npan-cultured and had no change in his CXR from . He has\nhad a RIJ line since  and this may be source, so it was\nd/c after peripheral access was attained. Pt also developed an\nasymptomatic UTI by UA and culture (growing pan-sensitive\nPseudomonas), however, he was not started on abx given that he\ndid not spike a fever and did not become hemodynamically\nunstable.",

EKG showed atrial fibrillation with\nRBBB, ST elevation in I and avF with ST depressions in V1-V3,\nconsistent with postero-lateral infarct. Atrial fibrillation\nself converted to a sinus rhythm.  Troponin peaked at 10.84. CK\npeaked at 5707 and CKMB peaked at 442.  The patient started on\nArctic Sun cooling protocol and rewarmed. Patient had cardiac\ncatheterization given EKG changes and an OM1 lesion was stented\nwith a bare metal stent (please see Cath results above).\nInitially, the patient received fluids for blood pressure\nsupport when blood pressure resolved, he was diuresised with\nlasix drip. In the setting of hypotension the patient developed\nshock liver that resolved in three days.  The patient was\nsuccessfully extubated on .\n-Continue Plavix 75 mg daily\n-Continue ASA 325 mg daily\n-Continue metoprolol succinate 100 mg q day\n-Continue lisinopril 5 mg q day\n\n# Altered mental status: After rewarming from the cooling\nprotocol, the patient was acutely agitated and disoriented.  He\nrequired IV Haldol for agitation.  Since that time, he has been\ncalm, but still confused.  He initially made inappropriate\nstatements, with tangential and circumferential thinking.\nCurrently, he is alert and oriented to place, time, and person,\nalthough he remains confused about the time line of his heart\nattack.  He had an Head MRI revealing no acute intracranial\nabnormalities and will be follow by Neurology as an outpatient.\n\n.\n# Aspiration Acquired PNA:  The patient was febrile prior to and\nafter extubation.  It was believed that he had an aspiration\nevent prior to being intubated and during his PMA arrest.  His\nBC were negative, and his sputum culture grew out Methicillin\nsensitive S. Aureus.  He had been placed on cefepime,\nvancomycin, and metronidazole for empiric coverage.  However, he\ndeveloped a maculopapular rash that was believed to be secondary\nto cefepime.  After his sputum culture grew out MSSA he was\nplaced on linezolid.\n- Continue Linezolid for aspiration PNA until .\n.\n# Urinary retention: Foley was d/c??????d on  and did not urinate\nfor 10 hours.  Bladder scan revealed 460 cc after attempted\nurination.  A straight catheter was attempted and failed to\nevacuate more urine.  Patient was able to urinate another 200 cc\nand patient refusing foley catheter.  After being transferred to\nthe floor the patient had 2 PVR showing 400 cc of urine in the\nbladder.  At that time he had mild suprapubic discomfort.  His\nurinary retention was thought to be secondary to decreased\ncontraction after being cooled.  He will need to be straight\ncathed, and he will need to receive tamsulosin.\n- Daily in/out catheterization for urinary retention\n- Daily post void residuals\n- Tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily\n.\n# MVA: Sternal pain upon deep inspiration.   be secondary to\nair bag deployment.  Upon arrival to the hospital his initial\ntrauma evaluation did not reveal any abnormalities.\n.\n# Afib s/p vfib arrest self-converted into SR: Resolved. Chads\nscore is Zero.\n.\n# Acute Renal failure:  While cooled his blood pressure and\nurine output were poor.  He required IVF for blood pressure\nsupport.  He then required diuresis, and creatinine peaked at\n1.3 but slowly trended down.  During diuresis his FeNa was less\nthan 1%.  His discharge creatinine was 1.0.\n.\n# Elevated LFTs: His LFTs were elevated, but trended down.  This\nwas likely due to shock liver in the setting of v.fib arrest.\n.\n# Hypothyroid: Throughout his hospital course his Levothyroxine\nwas continued at 50mcg daily.\n.\n# Loose Stool: 3 loose bowel movements prior to discharge.\nStarted on Loperamide.",

Female patient with a history of dementia,\nHTN, recent section 12 for SA, SI who presented  Newbridge\non the  s/p fall w/ rt femoral neck fx now with fracture\nrepair but post-op hypoxia leading to discovery of PE on CTA\nfrom today.\n.\nPatient was admitted to the Orthopaedic Surgery Trauma service\nfollowing right basicervical femoral neck fx s/p fall from\nstanding.  She was seen and cleared for surgery by medicine.\nShe underwent a right hip hemiarthroplasty on HD#1.  She\ntolerated the procedure well, see op report for full details.\nAfter a brief stay in the PACU, she was transferred to the\nfloor.\n.\nPost-op, her pain seemed well controlled but there was concern\nthat pt might be underreporting pain  to dementia. She was\nstarted lovenox for DVT prophylaxis postoperatively.\n.\nOn post-op day #2 she experienced an episode of hypotension and\nunresponsiveness.  She was transferred to the trauma SICU where\nshe recieved 2 units PRBCs with an appropriate increase in Hct.\nHer BP normalized and she did not require vasopressors.  She was\nalso noted to have a troponin bump to 0.3 with hypotension and\nunresponsiveness associated with Q=waves in III and aVF which\ntrended down following transfer to the ICU, thought to be due to\ndemand ischemia.  In the ICU she was noted to be in atrial\nfibrillation with normal rate. Pt had new hypoxia for which she\nwas started on nasal cannula oxygen.\n.\nA medicine consult was obtained and recommendation was made for\nCTA to work-up PO and beta-blockers to control heart rate. On\n ECHO showed mildly dilated LA and moderately dilated RA.\nRV cavity was dilated with depressed free wall contractility.\nModerate Pulm HTN was noted. These findings combinened with the\ntroponin leak and new onset of tachycardia which appeared to be\nsinus increased concern for PE. CTA on  showed left lower\nlobe subsegmental isolated pulmonary embolism. CT incidentally\nshowed four 2-5 mm pulmonary nodules in this ex-smoker, a\n12-month surveillance CT is suggested by radiology. Due to PE pt\nwas started on therapeutic lovenox 70mg SubQ Q12hrs and\nmetoprolol was uptitrated to 25mg  to help control heart rate\nand prevent rate related ischemia. Pt was also started on\nwarfarin on  with plan to bridge to warfarin with lovenox,\nINR goal 2.0-3.0.\n.\nPt had elevated BPs a day or two post op which combined with\nintermittent heart rate elevations was determined to be  to\nuntreated pain. Pt continued to deny pain in any areas including\nhip - there was concern that combination of dementia and overall\nsickness was causing pt to under-report pain but due to elderly\nage it was difficult to give standing narcotics. When narcotics\nwere given BP would come back down into more normal ranges and\npt seemed more comfortable overall.\n.\nAt time of discharge pt was sating in the low to mid 90s on RA\nand mid 90s on 2L NC. Pt with long smoking history so unlikely\nhas baseline O2 sats in high 90s. Her respiratory status was\ndeemed to be near baseline as a result although she was deemed\nseverely deconditioned  to the hip surgery and bed rest.\n.",

She presented to  where\nCT c-spine showed multiple cervical fractures and the patient\nwas transferred to  for further neurosurgical workup. She\npresented with right tricep weakness. She was admitted to\nneurosurgery and an MRI of the c-spine was obtained. She was\nfound to have a C7 burst fracture as well as facet fractures.\n\nMRI imaging was performed and she was scheduled for surgery.\nPre-op eval showed UTI and cipro was started on . She\nunderwent a C6-T1 posterior instrumented fusion with Dr  on\n5.17 and was transported to the ICU intubated after surgery.\nShe remained intubated in the ICU and had poor urine output\npost-operatively.  On  she went to the OR with Dr.  for\na C7 corpectomy with allograft and plate and was transported\nback to the SICU post-operatively.  She tolerated the procedure\nwell.  Upon returning to the SICU she was noted to have\ntachycardia with hypotension which appeared rate related.  She\nreceived lopressor and was placed on a diltiazem drip. Her vital\nsigns remained stable on  while on the diltiazem drip and\nshe moved all four extremtiies and was interactive via head\nnods.\n\nOn  the patient had CXR showing a potential\npneumomediastinum.  She had a Chest CT as well as a bronchoscopy\nand BAL and no study could definitively find a source.  She was\nalso started on triple antibiotics as empiric coverage for\npotential esophageal rupture. Her INR increased to 2.6 and she\nreceived vitamin K as well as started on TPN with Vitamin K due\nto the potential that her increased INR was from malnutrition.\nOn 5.23 she was increasingly fluid volume overloaded and\nreceived 20 of IV Lasix with good effect.  Also on the 23rd she\nhad a drainage bag placed to her weeping left hand wound from a\nprevious IV placement.\nShe was able to be weaned from ventilator and extubated  but\nthen increasing respiratory difficulties prompted re-intubation\nmorning of . On  she remained intubated on CMV and a\ntrach was placed due to her unstable respiratory status.\n\nOn the weekend of  and  she began to develop uremia and\nacute renal failure, as well as elevated LFTs.  Renal was\nconsulted for the possibility of placing the patient on\ndialysis.  A MRCP was performed which did not reveal any\nretained stones or cholelithiasis. And further work up was held\nas her renal issues took precedence though there were no acute\nsurgical issues and LFTs should be followed in the future.\n\nOn  a hemodialysis catheter was placed and she was started on\ncontinuous -venous hemodialysis. She diueresed nicely with\nthis.  Her wounds continued to be well healed.  her mental\nstatus continued to be depressed with only intermittent\nfollowing of commands.\n\nShe continued on CVVH  until  and diuersis of her positive\nfluid balance was acheived and she became more interactive.\nAfter the discontinuation of the CVVH her mental status began to\ndecline again and she was now intermittently following commands.\nShe remained stable and is being medically managed by the SICU\nwith renal service input including management of lasix drip for\ndiuersis.

She was seen in the Emergency\nRoom, outside scans were reviewed and her vital signs remained\nstable.  She was admitted to the Trauma ICU for management.\n\nHer airway was monitored closely as she had a prevertebral\nhematoma presumed secondary to her multiple cervical fractures.\nThis proved to be  problem, her oxygen saturations were stable\nand she was able to cough up her secretions.  Her hematocrit was\nalso followed and she was transfused with 2 units of packed red\nblood cells for a hematocrit of 21.  Subsequently she maintained\na hematocrit in the 25-26 range.  Her neurologic status remained\nintact.  There was no evidence of any decreased sensation or\nparesthesias in her extremities.\n\nDuring her ICU stay the Vascular and Neurosurgery services were\nconsulted as her CTA of the neck was concerning for a right\nvertebral dissection vs. atherosclerotic changes.  She was\nbriefly placed on heparin however at discharge she will be\nplaced on aspirin and Plavix and will have a repeat CTA of the\nneck in 2 weeks.  At that time further recommendations for\nanticoagulation will be given. She was asymptomatic from that\nstandpoint.\n\nHer blood sugars were out of control on admission requiring an\ninsulin drip for the first 3 days however she was transitioned\nto part of her pre admission Levemir dose and this has gradually\nbeen adjusted to attempt to keep her sugars between 60 and 120.\n\nDue to her multiple issues a PICC line was placed for\nmedications and phlebotomy however this may be for the short\nterm.  Her diet was advanced to a diabetic diet and she was able\nto eat without any difficulty.  Her foley catheter is scheduled\nto be removed at midnight tonight.\n\nFollowing transfer to the Trauma floor she was evaluated by\nPhysical Therapy and Occupational Therapy as she was quite\nlimited in her ability to move with her multiple fractures and\northotics.

Degloving injury of the left frontoparietal scalp without\nfracture.\n3. Please refer to the concurrent CT c-spine report for cervical\nspine\nassessment.\n\n CT C Spine : There is a linear lucency involving the\nright lateral mass of C2, best seen on series 4 image 29 likely\nrepresenting a non-displaced fracture.  At C3 there is a chip\nfracture involving the left transverse process not extending to\nthe foramen transversarium. At C4 there is also a chip fracture\ninvolving the left transverse process not extending into the\ntransverse foramen. At C5 and C6 there are fractures of the left\ntransverse process which do extend to the transverse foramen\nwith the fractured lateral fragments slightly laterally and\ninferior displaced, clearly depicted on the coronal\nreformations. There is a fracture involving the C7 right\ntransverse process best seen on series 4 image 73 involving the\ntransverse foramina. There is also a fracture involving the C1\nright transverse process best seen on series 4 image 24 as well\nas series 9 image 53 which does not clearly extend to the\ntransverse foramina. Irregularity at the superior endplate of C7\nis likely related to motion artifact. However, given the lucent\nline seen on series 4 image 71 involving the superior endplate\nof C7 a fracture cannot be entirely\nexcluded.\nBilateral rib fractures involving the posterior arch of the\nfirst ribs is\nseen. The left posterior second rib is also fractured. On the\nlateral view\nthere is maintenance of cervical alignment. Small amount of\ndegenerative\ndisease is noted in the mid cervical spine with loss of disc\nspace and small spurring. A posterior disc-osteophyte complex is\nseen at C4-5 and C5-6.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue\nswelling.  IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures involving the cervical\nspine as detailed above\nwith involvement of the transverse process and several fractures\ninvolving the transverse foramina. Correlate with CTA to assess\nfor associated vertebral artery injury. No malalignment or\nevidence of unstable fracture. An MRI spine to further assess as\nclinically warranted.\n\n CTA Head and Neck :\n  Segmental non-visualization of the right vertebral artery\npredominantly more proximally.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "yo F with chronic subdural hematoma, dementia, HTN, a fib\nadmitted with acute mental status change.\n.\n*) Mental status change: Pt has hx of chronic subdural hematoma,\nfirst diagnosed , with expansion on subsequent imaging\n(approx 2 weeks later) and \"slight increase in thickness\" of\nhemorrhage on imaging this PM. Today, became agitated, hostile,\nconfused, and paranoid. Was recently treated for UTI, but UA in\nED consistent with UTI. Mental status change likely worsening chronic subdural hematoma in combination with UTI and\nknown Alzheimer's dementia. Neurosurgery followed throughout\nadmission and family and pt did consent for burr hole drainage\nof hematoma, which occurred on HD#7. Procedure was\nuncomplicated. Please see full operative note for details. She\nwas transferred to the TSICU for a short period of recovery and\nwas called out to the floor on POD#1. She was started on\ndilantin for seizure prophylaxis, but was extremely sedated on\nPOD#2. Given concern for continued bleeding versus infection, an\nextensive workup was initiated. Her head CT was unchanged, CXR\nWNL, UA not c/w UTI, and EEG without seizure activity. Neurology\nwas consulted and neurosurgery also assessed pt. Given lack of\nabnormal results, most likely culprit was determined to be\ndilantin, as level was corrected with albumin to 21\n(supratherapeutic). By POD#3, her mental status began to return\nto baseline and neurosurgery recommended d/c'ing dilantin as\nrisk of sedation outweighs risk of seizure activity. Throughout\nthe rest of her hospitalization, her mental status was at\nbaseline--alert, responsive to verbal stimuli, follows commands,\ngenerally sensical speech with evidence of dementia, lack of\norientation to time/place.\n.\n*) UTI: Initially thought to be contributing to mental status\nchange. Culture of previous UTI showed urogenital contamination,\nthough pt tx with cipro. Pt did not have additional systemic sx\nlike fever, chills, back pain. Pt was started on ceftriaxone,\ntransitioned to cefpodoxime, but antibiotics were d/c'd when\nurine culture returned as contaminated. Pt had a second UTI on\nPOD#3, which was negative.\n.\n*) Poor PO intake: Pt was seen by nutrition, who suggested\nEnsure supplementation with meals. Despite return to baseline\nmental status, pt did not take in significant POs. IV fluids\nwere continued to ensure adequate hydration and should be\ncontinued upon discharge (D5 1/2NS @ 60cc/hr) until tolerating\nadequate POs.\n.\n*) Atrial fibrillation: Pt was mostly in NSR during the\nhospitalization, with occassional episodes of coarse a fib with\nreturn to NSR. Not on anticoagulation  fall risk and SDH.\nTEDs and pneumoboots were placed for prophylaxis. No indication\nfor tele. Per neurosurgery, safe to restart ASA on POD#7. Will\ndefer to provider following pt upon discharge.\n.\n*) HTN: BPs stable without meds.\n.\n*) Gout: Continued colchicine.\n.\n*) Anemia: Continued iron.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "year-old W with a recent healthcare-associated pneumonia\n(), presented to the ED with dyspnea and palpitations,\nwas found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure and sepsis in\nsetting of a new large R-sided pneumonia. She was intubated in\nthe Emergency Room and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit (MICU) where she spent a brief period of time on levophed\nto keep her blood pressures adequate. She was started on broad\nspectrum antibiotics, extubated without difficulty, and\ntransferred to the Medicine floor for further management.\n.\n# Pneumonia: Possibly occurred secondary to aspiration, although\nunable to tell definitively per a Speech and Swallow evaluation.\nThe patient received eight days of intravenous vancomycin,\naztreonem, and ciprofloxacin to treat her large right-sided\npneumonia. These antibiotics were chosen in light of her many\nantibiotic allergies. She also received schedueled nebulizer\ntreatments, chest physical therapy, beside respiratory\nsuctioning, and an acapella valve. She never had a leukocytosis\nor fever. Her blood and sputum cultures were all negative.\nRepeat chest imaging suggested an increasing component of fluid\noverload, for which she was treated with diuretics. Her oxygen\nrequirement was slowly weaned from 2 liters via nasal canula to\n1 liter at the time of discharge. This should continue to be\nweaned, as tolerated, at rehab. She did not have a home oxygen\nrequirement prior to admission.\n.\n# Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The\npatient's diuretics were held upon admission to the hospital\nsecondary to low blood pressures and concern for sepsis. After\ntransfer to the floor the patient began to demonstrate signs of\nincreasing volume overload on her CXR and physical exam. She was\ndiuresed with IV lasix then transitioned to her oral home\nregimen. Her dyspnea and peripheral edema improved. A repeat\nechocardiogram was obtained and showed severe pulmonary\nhypertension, moderate right ventricular dilation and mild\nglobal hypokinesis, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with\npreserved left ventricular function, moderate tricuspid\nregurgitation, and mild to moderate aortic and mitral\nregurgitation. She will need continued monitoring of her daily\nweight, Ins and Outs (weigh diapers/pads), and physical exam to\ndetermine her current volume status and need for additional\ndiuresis.\n.\n# Atrial Fibrillation: Once her blood pressures were stable, the\npatient was continued on her home regimen of Metoprolol 25 mg\ntwice daily for rate control, and Coumadin for anticoagulation.\nHer INR level fluctuated, likely secondary to concurrent\nantibiotics, so this will need to be monitored and re-dosed as\nneeded in the future (goal INR ).\n.\n# Acute exacerbation of chronic venous stasis: Upon transfer to\nthe floor it was evident that the patient was experiencing an\nacute  of her chronic venous stasis. This improved with\ninitiation of diuresis and topical triamcinolone applied twice\ndaily.\n.\n# Delirium (resolved): During majority of her hospital admission\nthe patient was alert, attentive, and oriented to person,\nlocation, and date. She did experience an episode of visual\nhallucinations and waxing/ consciousness in the setting of\nnot having a bowel movement in two days. Additionally, she had\nbeen receiving ciprofloxacin, which can cause such effects in\nelderly individuals. A more aggressive bowel regimen was started\nand the patient improved to baseline.\n.\n# Anemia: The patient has evidence of a chronic normocytic\nanemia. Her hematocrit remained close to baseline 25-30 during\nthis admission. Fe studies revealed a low Fe (19), low-normal\nferritin (74), and decreased TIBC. The benefit of starting iron\nsupplementation, or pursuing a further evaluation should be\naddressed in the future by her outpatient provider.  studies\nshould be repeated when not actively ill.\n.\n# HTN: The patient's blood pressures remained in the systolic\nrange of 90-110 and diastolic range of 50-60 while being\nactively diuresed.\n.\n# GERD: The patient's home PPI regimen of Omeprazole was\ncontinued.\n.\n# Hx of Breast CA: The patient was on Exemestane prior to\nadmission. This was not continued during her hospital admission,\nbut re-started upon discharge.\n.\n# Speech and Swallow: The patient was evaluated a number of\ntimes by Speech who advanced her diet to soft solids and thin\nliquids, meds whole with puree, and recommended swallow follow\nup in rehab to ensure diet tolerance and consider further\nupgrades.\n.\n# Physical Therapy: The patient was evaluated by physical\ntherapy who suggested rehab for continued strength building.\n.\n# Code status: The patient was full code during this admission.\n.\n# Health Care Proxy: Granddaughter  )\n.\n# Other Considerations: Prior to hospitalization that patient\nwas quite physically functional, able to climb 17 stairs without\ngetting dyspneic. She went to church weekly. She had an aide\ncome to bath her, and occasionally help her dress, but most of\nthe time she could dress herself. She has help with cooking and\ncleaning, but can feed herself.",

He was transferred to the CCU after developing\nhypotension with associated mental status change after attempted\ndiuresis with IV lasix drip along with nesiritide. In order to\ntreat the hypotension, consideration must be given to his poor\nheart function which, in and of itself, likely has large\ncontribution to the hypotensive picture.  The patient was\nstarted on lasix drip with dopamine for inotropic support. His\nhemodynamic status remained tenuous and his urine output was\nonly marginally satisfactory.  The following morning the patient\nwent into atrial fibrillation and became hypotensive.\nCardioversion was not successful.  Levophed was started for\nblood pressure support, dopamine was weaned. Chemical\ncardioversion and rate control was successfully achieved with\namiodarone.  The patients hemodynamic status improved.  The\nfollowing morning, however, the patient again became hypotensive\nwith increasing oxygen requirement and declining urinary output.\n Mental status unchanged.  Vasopressin was added for blood\npressure support.\n\nGiven these events, Dr.  called a family meeting to explain\nthat the prognosis, unfortunately, was extremely poor.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mrs  is a 54 yo woman with hx charcot  tooth,\nosteogenesis imperfecta, COPD who presented to  medical\ncenter on  after fall, was found to have\nmultiple left sided rib fractures ( posterolaterally and 8\nthrough 11 posteriorly) as well as a LLL consolidation. She was\ntreated there for PNA and pain control; then developed AMS due\nto hypercapnia, with subsequent respiratory failure and CXR\nshowing bilateral consolidations concerning for ARDS. There, she\nfailed Bipap and was intubated; course was complicated by ARF\nthought to be due to ATN from hypotension (? but did not require\npressors?). Pt was transferred to  for further management.\n.\n1. Respiratory failure: Unclear if initially pt was hypoxic or\nhypercarbic, however initiaing event appears to be PNA. Pt also\nwith underlying structural abnormalities including scoliosis and\nnumerous left sided rib fractures as above. Pt transferred with\npersistent bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and with no evidence of\nheart failure on echo, was most suspicious for ARDS, and was\nARDSnet ventilated.\n.\nShe was given MDI's, but no steroids as COPD not suspected. Pt\nwas diuresed with IV Lasix to address minimal volume overload.\nShe was on the ventilator until  when she was extubated. She\ninitially did have some increased WOB and discussion of whether\nshe would desire re-intubation was discussed with her and her\nfamily; she did desire re-intubation if that were felt\nnecessary. However, through the next couple days we kept a close\neye on her and she improved over time with decreased WOB and\nrespiratory status overall much improved, and she was satting\nwell on 40-50% facetent (shovel mask) and 4L NC by discharge.\n.\nShe had increased sputum production and desaturations with\nminimal amounts of exertion and would benefit from continued\npulmonary PT. Would also recommend standing\nAlbuterol/Ipratropium inhalers q6 and additional Albuterol prn.\nOf note, her CXR continued to show bilateral patchy infiltrates\nby discharge, but she had clinically much improved.\n.\n2. LLL consolidation: noted at  where she was started\non Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin (briefly on Linezolid instead of Vanc but\nswitched back to Vanc on  admission) and she completed a\ncourse for HAP (unclear exact duration, but was > 7-10 days).\nShe was admitted with WBC count 27.1 which improved to 15.0 by\ntime of discharge. Last fever was 100.7 on  at 4am. Sputum\nand BAL cultures did not grow anything either here or at  (see below, Leukocytosis)\n.\n3. Acute renal failure: Creatine at OSH 3.7, with unclear prior\nbaseline, and was 4.1 on admission to . Concern for ATN\ngiven ? history of hypotension; however did not seem to be\nprolonged based on notes.  Renal was consulted and sediment\nseemed consistent with ATN. Renal u/s showed no signs of\nobstruction. A 24 hr urine Cr collection showed a calculated GFR\nof 26. She was not anuric and had normal electrolytes, and in\nfact then entered in the polyuria phase of ATN, with a large\nvolume of UOP.  She was briefly given 1/2 NS to keep up with\nsodium losses to prevent hypovolemia per renal recs, and would\nbenefit from frequent electrolytes checks at least initially\nuntil they are seen to be stable. UOP should also be carefully\nmonitored, and our goals were to keep her ins and outs even.\n.\nCreatinine was trended, peaked to 4.8, and continue to downtrend\nto 3.1-3.3 by discharge, again with unclear baseline. *** She\nwill need follow up with our renal department within 1 month to\nreassess her renal function ***\n.\n4. Leukocytosis: Most likely due to pulmonary infection +/-\nrecent steroid use (she was not given steroids at , unclear\nif given at OSH). Treated for HCAP as above. Cultures from\nblood, sputum, BAL, and CDiff were all negative. Her initial WBC\ncount of 27 downtrended to a persistently elevated WBC count of\n15 by discharge, but she continued to be afebrile and was\nclinically much improved.\n.\nAlso of note,  micro lab was contact and sputum was\nconsistent with respiratory flora, blood cultures were negative,\nand urine culture negative.\n.\n5. Rib Fractures: Trauma surgery was consulted, who felt it\nunlikely that the rib fractures would pose a threat to\nbreathing, and unlikely to be flail chest. Recommended\nsupportive treatments, and pt was started on Oxycodone for pain\ncontrol after extubation.\n.\n6. Anemia: unclear baseline. Her Hct was 33.5 on admission and\ndowntrended through admission, and was 26.7 on discharge. No\nsigns/symptoms of bleeding, hemolysis labs negative; iron\nstudies were consistent with ACD.\n.\n7. LUE Skin tear: Wound care with mepilex.\n.\n8. Hypernatremia: Very mildly to Na 147 for a couple days, then\ntrended down to normal Na 139 by discharge.\n.\n9. Diarrhea: Before discharge she was noted to have some\ndiarrhea. She had had 2 negative Cdiff's and was afebrile, with\ndecreasing WBC count by discharge so low suspicion for\ninfection. Would continue to monitor.\n.\n10. Social: Of note, pt had noted during admission that her\nhusband is an alcoholic and she did not want to see him right\nnow. Her daughter  (number below) was called just before the\npt was discharged and we confirmed that the pt would be\ndischarged to  LTAC.\n.\n11. Access: She had a LUE PICC line placed, and a 22g PIV. She\nwas given subQ Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.\n.\n12. Communication:  , , ; Sr, husband, , , daughter ; Dr.\n at Southshore  was contact  .\n13. Full code\n.\n14. Dispo: The pt will be discharged to  LTAC for\nfurther rehabilitation.\n.\n15. Medication reconciliation: Of note, unable to fully\nreconcile home medication list.

She was initially taken to an outside facility\nwhere she was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a\nhematocrit of 23.  Once her vital signs stabilized, she was\ntransferred to the  under\nthe acute care service.  Upon admission, she was made NPO, given\nintravenous fluids, and underwent serial hematocrit checks.  The\nGI service was consulted and recommended an EGD.  Prior to the\nEGD, she was started on a protonix and octreotide drip.\n\nShe was admitted to the intensive care unit where she was\nintubated for an EGD. Her vital signs and hematocrit were\nclosely monitored. On HD #2, she underwent an EGD which showed a\nsingle linear 3 cm ulcer in the fundus.  One triclip was\nsuccessfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis. Her\nhematocrit remained stable after the procedure and she was\nextubated.\n\nShe was transferred to the surgical floor on HD #3 with stable\nvital signs.  Her foley catheter was removed and she voided\nwithout difficulty.  She was started on a regular diet. She has\nresumed her home medications. Her hematocrits have remained\nstable.  She has had bouts of decreased oxygenation with\nambulation, but normalize the rest.  She has been evaluated by\nphysical therapy and recommendations were made for discharge to\na rehabilitation facility where she can further regain her\nstrength and mobility.\n\nIncidentally, Mrs.  has had a difficult time with IV\naccess during her prior two hospitalizations.  Each admission,\nperipheral venous catheters were difficult to place and the\npatient required central venous line placement while in the ICU.\n She is being discharged without venous access since she\nrequires no parenteral medications or frequent blood draws.\n\nAt time of discharge, Mrs.  is hemodynamically stable,\noxygenating well on room air, afebrile, and has no pain or\ndiscomfort.  The patient's surgical staples were removed and\nsteri-strips applied today.  A follow-up appointment has been\nmade with the ACS service.  She should also follow-up with her\nPCP within the next 3 - 4 weeks.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr.  was admitted to the  Spine Surgery Service on\n and taken to the Operating Room for a cervical fusion\nthrough an anterior approach C5-7. Please refer to the dictated\noperative note for further details. The surgery was without\ncomplication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in\nstable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative\nDVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard\nprotocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.\nPost-operatively he was noticed to be confused and withdrawing\nfrom alcohol.  He was transfered to the T/SICU for further\nmanagement.  On HD#3 he returned to the operating room for a\nscheduled posterior cervical fusion as part of a staged 2-part\nprocedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note for\nfurther details. The second surgery was also without\ncomplication and the patient returned to the T/SICU intubated.\n.\nHe was subsequently extubated without difficulty but failed a\nspeech and swallow likely secondary to soft tissue swelling from\nhis surgeries.  A Dobhoff was placed and he was given tubefeeds.\nHis further withdrawal symptoms were managed with ativan and\nvalium. He pulled out his Dobhoff tube on . He was\ntransfered to the medical service for further management.\n.\nOn the medical service, he failed a second speech and swallow\nevaluation on  and another Dobhoff tube was placed on .\nWe started him on thiamine and a multivitamin and continued his\nfolate. It was felt that his altered mental status was largely\ndue to delirium and not alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal,\nand we thus sought to minimize use of narcotics and\nbenzodiazepines.\n.\nOn , Mr.   an unfortunate fall to the floor\nas he was getting out of his chair. He had a CT scan of his head\nand complete spine, which showed no acute intracranial process\nand no fractures. An x-ray of his right elbow showed a tiny\nnon-displaced fracture of his radial head. His right arm was put\nin a sling, and on discahrge was recommended for full  of\nmotion, non weight bearing, and sling for comfort.\nSubsequently, he was kept with a 1:1 sitter until his transfer\nto an outside hospital.\n.\nThe patient had several aspiration events associated with a\nbrief desaturation and occasional fever. The differential for\nthese fevers included aspiration pneumonitis vs. neuroleptic\nmalignant syndrome.  His CXRs did not demonstrate a\nconsolidation and making pneumonia less likely although he\ncertainally is at risk for developing a true aspiration PNA.\nAll psych meds were stopped due to concern of NMS and he\nremained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout rest of\nhospital stay. While at  hospital these psych meds\nshould be restarted soon after arrival. He was re-evaluated by\nSpeech and Swallow on  and again failed a bedside speech and\nswallow exam.  On  he underwent a video swallow study that\nshowed mild-moderate tongue weakness, near absent epiglottic\ndeflection, and edema near the level of the UES in line with new\ncervical spinal hardware.  These defects resulted in aspiration\nwith both nectar thick liquids and purees.  Based on these\nresults, it was recommended that patient be kept NPO without\noral meds.  A dobhoff was placed for nutrition but he pulled it\nout the same day before it could be utilized for tube feeds.\nThe next day, another dobhoff was attempted and patient was kept\non restraints so as not to pull it out.  Tube feeds were started\non .\n.\nGiven that he does not tolerate  -gastric tube well, a more\nlong-term means of non-oral nutrition should be pursued,\npossibly with a PEG tube.  We discussed the issue of the PEG\ntube with the patient and his wife on .  However, his wife\nexpressed her desire for the patient to be transferred to  Center to be under the care of his primary care\nphysician.   patient should continue this discussion on a\nmeans for long-term nutrition at his outside hospital.  If he is\ndischarged to a rehab facility without a PEG tube in place, he\nshould continue to be kept NPO until re-evaluation one week\nlater with a repeat swallow study.  He should receive intensive\nswallow therapy and cognitive-linguistic treatment in a rehab\nsetting.  He should also receive q4h oral care while NPO.  He\nalso had episodes of oxygen desaturations to the high 80s that\nimproved to the high 90s with both oxygen via nasal cannula and\nwith suctioning of oral secretions.  By discharge, his oxygen\nsaturation was stable in the mid to high 90s on room air.\nPlease note: blood cultures were still pending on discharge.\n.\nOf note, patient continued to show signs of sun-downing until\nthe 2 days before transfer. Delirium persisted despite the fact\nthat he was ostensibly taken off all possible sedatives,\nincluding benzos and his psychiatric medications.  Patient\nperiodically agitated, often requiring restraints.  He was\ncombative off restraints and received one dose of 5mg zyprexa IM\nwhich did not alleviate symptoms.  Psych consult was obtained to\nevaluate and recommended starting 1mg haldol standing and 1mg\nqhs prn on . QTC was mildly prolonged to 455 and thus he was\nchanged to liquid haldol. His psych meds were so far in the\nhospitalization but citalopram was started at low dose and\nshould be titrated up. Patient's mental status improved after\nthe haldol; he was alert and oriented x 3 the next morning .\nCXR, UA, and blood cx were unremarkable.  TSH, B12, folate, and\nRPR were checked as part of delirium work up and were pending on\ndischarge.\n.\nHowever, throughout the day, he  became more somnolent and\nlethargic, out of proportion to the amount of haloperidol he was\nreceiving.  A urine toxicology returned on  positive for\nbenzos in the urine which had been discontinued since .  It\nis unclear why he had benzos in the urine at that time. Blood\ntoxicology was negative.\n\nOf note Mrs.  was updated daily by several members of the\nmedical team including Dr.  (attending), Dr.  (pgy3),\nand Dr.  (pgy1).

        "Brief Hospital Course": "The patient was admitted to the  general surgery service\non  and\nhad an open ventral hernia repair with component separation and\nmesh.  Patient tolerated procedure well but required\nneosynephrine for intraoperative hypotension.  Remained in PACU\nPOD0 to AM POD1 for hypotension/oliguria.  Admitted TSICU POD1\nfor blood pressure support, intensive hemodynamic monitoring.\n\nNeuro: Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural placed.\nPost-operatively, the epidural rate was decreased secondary to\nhypotension.  Hypothesized that epidural placement may have been\nintra-thecal given hypotension.  Epidural was capped and removed\nAM POD1 and patient started on  Dilaudid IV/PCA with good effect\nand adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the\npatient was transitioned to oral pain medications.\n\nCV: The patient was hypotensive in the operating room requiring\nneosynephrine for BP support.  This was attributed to having\ntaken AM dose ACE inhibitor and subsequently theorized to\npossibly be related to question of intrathecal placement of\nepidural catheter.  Hypotension persisted postop in PACU though\nnot accompanied by tachycardia. Patient received several boluses\nof 1L LR in PACU POD0-1 for hypotension/oliguria.  TTE POD1\ndemonstrated hyperdynamic physiology but no structure\nabnormality.  Following removal of epidural on POD1, BP improved\nand patient was weaned off pressors POD1-2 and this was\ntolerated well though with continued mild sinus tachycardia (HR\n95-105).  Home anti-hypertensives were resumed POD5-6.  Vital\nsigns were routinely monitored.\n\nPulmonary: Patient had persistent O2 requirement likely\nsecondary to baseline COPD, obesity and fluid overload given to\nsupport blood pressure.  POD1 patient received multiple doses of\nlasix to attempt diuresis and assist in pulmonary function.\nPOD2 patient was briefly started on a lasix gtt in setting of\nrespiratory distress.  CXR obtained at that time showed\npulmonary congestion and atelectasis.  Serial CXRs were\nperformed to assess pulmonary status and patient was\nintermittently diuresed to assist in fluid removal.  O2\nrequirement decreased in subsequent days and SaO2 improved with\nincreased patient activity.  Pulmonary toilet including\nincentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged.\nVital signs were routinely monitored.  At time of discharge, she\nstill had saturations in the mid-80s with exertion, and a\nbaseline of 93RA, 94 on 2L NC.  No obvious crackles or wheezing\non exam.\n\nGI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given multiple IVF\nboluses as outlined above.  Her diet was advanced to sips POD1\nand regular DM diet POD2, which was tolerated well. She was\nreturned to her normal, baseline bowel pattern which alternates\nbetween frequent, loose BMs and constipation.  She manages this\nw diet at baseline and has continued to do so. Patient was\noliguric in PACU as mentioned above requiring multiple IVF\nboluses and neosynephrine to support renal perfusion.  Patient\nwas hep locked on POD1 and did not require additional IVF\nthrougout stay.  Cr checked on POD1 showed increase from\n0.9(baseline) to 2.1.  FeNa 0.1% c/w prerenal.  Cr rose again to\n2.4 POD2 but then decreased to baseline over following days.  As\nabove lasix given on multiple occasions to support urine output\nand diurese fluid overload.  Foley was removed on POD#5 and\npatient voided appropriately. Intake and output were closely\nmonitored.\n\nID: Preoperatively, the patient was given\nvancomycin/levofloxacin and this was continued for one\nadditional postop dose. The patient's temperature was closely\nwatched for signs of infection.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible.\n\nHEME: Patient's hct was checked postop and found to be similar\nto preop value (38->34).  This remained consistent over course\nof admission with no significant change from baseline.\n\nAt the time of discharge on POD 8, the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.",

VPA level was found to\nbe 29 despite recent dose increase to 750mg TID, so most likely\nreason for her seizure was suspected missed doses of AEDs (VPA +\nKeppra) secondary to blocked PEG tube. She was loaded with IV\nVPA and Keppra in the ED. NCHCT also showed acute on chronic L\nSDH and  of L lateral ventricle, so VPS causing SDH could have been contributing. Toxic-metabolic workup\nwas otherwise negative.\n\n20-minute EEG subsequently showed multiple right-sided PLEDs and\n3 electrographic seizures, so patient was admitted to the\nEpilepsy Monitoring Unit for closer monitoring.\n\nIn the hospital, patient remained on bedside EEG for five days.\nOn EEG she initially was found to be having extremely frequent\nepileptiform discharges and electrographic seizures located over\nthe right hemisphere with few clinical correlates (except for\noccasional left facial twitching and left hand twitching):\ndiagnosis was non-convulsive status epilepticus. Accordingly,\nher anti-epileptics were aggressively uptitrated. First her\nKeppra was increased to 2000mg IV BID. Then she was started on\nstanding lorazepam. Next, she was started on trial of Lacosamide\nfor non-convulsive status. Her seizure frequency improved\ngreatly after uptitration of these meds, and her mental status\nseemed to improve slightly in that she was more responsive to\nexaminers with fewer nystagmoid eye movements on day of\ndischarge. Her discharge AED regimen is as follows: VPA 750mg\nTID (home dose), Keppra 2000mg , Lacosamide 150mg , and\nlorazepam 0.5mg TID. Plan is for her to taper the lorazepam to\noff over the next 15 days: 0.5mg TID x5 days, then 0.5mg  x5\ndays (starting ), then 0.5mg daily x5 days (starting\n), then STOP.\n\n# VP SHUNT: NCHCT in the ED revealed VPS ,  VPS\nwas reprogrammed by neurosurgery. Patient will follow up with\nneurosurgery (Dr.  in 2 weeks for repeat NCHCT\nand evaluation of VPS.\n\n# GI: On HD #2 patient's damaged PEG tube was replaced under\nflouroscopy by Interventional Radiology. After this it\nfunctioned without any further issues. She will follow up with\nIR q3 months for routine replacement of PEG tube (to be\nscheduled by IR).\n\n# ID: no active issues during hospitalization.\n\n# CV: continued home metoprolol for HTN.\n\n# CHRONIC PROBLEMS\n\n- s/p TBI: continued home Baclofen (for muscle contractures) and\nAmantadine (for arousal) + Percocet PRN pain\n- Depression: continued home sertraline\n- s/p tracheostomy: continued home albuterol + ipratropium nebs\nPRN\n- GI ppx: continue home ranitidine\n- DVT ppx: SC heparin, pneumoboots\n- Precautions: seizures and falls\n\n=================================",

A VP shunt catheter is seen overlying the left\nchest, unchanged from prior exams. The lung volumes are low.  A\nlinear opacity at the right base and mild volume loss is\nconsistent with atelectasis.  Left basilar atelectasis is also\npresent.  This is similar in appearance to the prior chest\nradiograph in .  There is no pulmonary edema,\npleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal\nsilhouette is normal.\nIMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.\n\nEEG (): At baseline, the recording showed periodic\nlateralized\nepileptiform discharges (PLEDs) especially in the right frontal\ncentral area. In addition, there were three electrographic\nseizures with very rapid, rhythmic  Hz sharp wave activity\njust posterior to the frontal sharp waves on the right side. The\nseizures lasted about a minute. On video, there was no clear or\nmajor change in behavior. There was a bit of blinking. In one,\nin the right hand quivered a bit of the left was patent by\nblankets. There was no convulsion.\nABNORMALITY #2: Background activity was of very low voltage\nbroadly over the left side.\nHYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.\nINTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.\nSLEEP: The patient appeared to be awake between seizures, but no\nnormal\nwaking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the rightsided PLEDs, especially\nfrontally,\nwith the three electrographic seizures described above, with\nminimal clinical signs.\n\nEEG (): Began just after midnight on the night of the 31st\nand continued through 9:00 the next morning. Throughout the\nrecord, it showed extremely frequent sharp wave and following\nslow wave discharges widely over the right hemisphere and\nparticularly in frontal regions, but the periodic appearance had\ndiminished. The electrographic seizures, on the other hand,\nincreased in frequency. Bursts of spikes and sharp waves were\nfrequent sometimes for just two to three seconds but often in\nlonger runs constituting electrographic seizures. These seizures\noccurred about three times an hour and were not diminishing by\nthe time of the end of the recording. They usually remained\nrestricted to the right hemisphere. On video, there was usually\nno movement evident but, on one occasion, there was turning of\nher eyes to the left.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed extremely frequent rightsided\nspikes and\nsharp waves.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same electrographic\nseizures described above.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a disorganized background\nthroughout with\nextremely frequent epileptiform discharges broadly over the\nright hemisphere. Periodic discharges were no longer evident,\nbut there were extremely frequent bursts of more rapid\nepileptiform discharges for a few seconds at a time and also\nelectrographic seizures lasting a minute or more, about three\ntimes an hour, possibly increasing toward the end of the record.\n\nEEG (): Began at 7:01 on the morning of  and\nshowed a low voltage fast pattern in all areas, likely\nreflecting medication use. There continued somewhat periodic\npolysharp wave discharges broadly over the right hemisphere,\nappearing every three seconds or so. On the first morning, the\nsharp waves progressed to rapid,  Hz sharp and spike\nactivity especially in the right temporal region, spreading more\nbroadly over the right hemisphere and becoming seizures lasting\nthree to four minutes at a time. Typically, on video, there was\nno motor phenomena. The seizures occurred about three times an\nhour in the morning. By the afternoon, seizures were occurring a\nbit more than once an hour and, after 2:00, there were three\nseizures until the end of the recording at 7:00.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same innumerable right\nhemisphere spikes and sharp waves.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same seizures described\nabove.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed continued right hemisphere\nperiodic sharp\nwave discharges throughout, often at about one every two\nseconds. There were also very frequent three to four minute long\nelectrographic seizures beginning in the same area and spreading\nthrough most of the right hemisphere but usually with no motor\nfindings on video. Over the course of the recording, seizures\ndecreased markedly in frequency.\n\nEEG ():  Began at 7:01 on the morning of  and\ncontinued until 8 the next morning. For much of the record, it\nshowed less\nfrequent blood rate hemisphere sharp waves with some following\nslowing than it had shown on earlier recordings. These sharp\nwaves did not appear\nperiodically. There were 13 electrographic seizures recorded.\nThe first was\nat 7:29 on the first morning. It began in the same area as the\nright temporal sharp waves, maximal at T4-T6, with a \"PLEDs\nplus\" onset and rapid sharp activity following the larger sharp\nwave. This rhythmic sharp activity remained restricted to the\nright temporal region for about 12 seconds, and then there was\nsharp and very irregular  Hz activity in all areas for\nabout one minute. On video, there was no clear left facial\ntwitching or other movement. Very similar seizures occurred\nlater. They were somewhat less frequent beginning on the evening\nof the 23rd. A few were associated with facial twitching.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same very frequent right\nhemisphere\ndischarges.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same seizures described\nabove.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a disorganized background\nthroughout with\nvery frequent right hemisphere sharp and slow wave discharges,\nmaximal in the right anterior to mid temporal region. These\ndischarges occurred at least every few seconds but were not\nrhythmic or periodic. The same area was associated with the\nonset of all the electrographic and clinical seizures described\nabove. Seizures lasted for a minute or so and often had no\nclinical correlate. They were far less frequent than they were a\nfew days earlier.\n\nEEG (): Began at 7:01 on the morning of  and\ncontinued\nfor 24 hours. At the onset, it showed a very low voltage\nbackground in all\nareas. Frequencies were generally faster, but there was\nwidespread slowing\nover the right hemisphere, and there were area frequent moderate\nvoltage\npolymorphic sharp waves seen broadly over the right side\nparticularly in\ncentral and temporal areas. These sharp waves were not rhythmic\nor periodic. The record also showed three electrographic\nseizures, all beginning in the same area as the sharp waves just\ndescribed. Typically, the sharp waves became more periodic, at\nabout 1 Hz, four minutes before the seizure. On video, there was\nno facial twitching or other clear motor sign of the seizure.\nThey lasted about a minute.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same very frequent right\nhemisphere\nespecially central temporal, polymorphic sharp wave discharges.\nOverall, they became less frequent over the course of the\nrecording and gave way to\nirregular slowing. There were exceptions with more rapid and\nperiodic\ndischarges for short periods.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same seizures described\nabove at other periods of more rhythmic rightsided sharp waves.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There was a single activation for\nmovement or\ntechnical reasons, likely a mistake in activation. There were\nnone for\nclinical events.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a lower voltage fast\nbackground, likely\nindicative of medication effect. There continued to be prominent\nslowing\nbroadly over the right side, and there were very frequent right\ncentral\ntemporal sharp wave discharges. These are far less rhythmic than\non earlier\nrecordings. In the same area was involved three clinical\nseizures, around\nnoon, at 7 in the evening, and just before midnight. The seizure\nfrequency\nwas markedly reduced from that on earlier days.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr  is a 68 yo M with h/o NSCL cancer, s/p thoracentesis in\n admitted with cardiac tamponade.\n.\n1. Pericardial effusion: Patient was admitted with SOB and found\nto have a large pericardial effusion.  Clinically he was\nhemodynamically stable, however echo showed RV collapse and cath\nshowed equalization of diastolic pressures suggestive of\ntamponade physiology.  While in the cath lab a\npericardiocentesis was performed with drainage of 450cc of\nserosanguinous fluid.  A pericardial drain was placed and ~1L of\nfluid was drained over the next 24 hours.  A repeat ECHO was\ndone at that time which showed resolution of his effusion.  He\nremained hemodynamically stable and the drain was pulled after\n48 hours once the output had decreased.  Thoracic surgery was\nconsulted and decision was made to perform pericardial window\nwhich was done on  in the OR. The effusion is likely\nmalignant, however cytology is still pending.\n.\n2. Hypertension: patient was continued on his outpatient regimen\nof Benicar and verapamil with good control of his BP.\n.\n3. Pleural effusion: Patient is s/p thoracentesis in  and\nnow with reaccumulation of fluid.  It was felt that his SOB was\nmore likely secondary to his pleural effusion than his\npericardial effusion as his symptoms did not improve\nsignificantly following pericardiocentesis, however he did not\nhave an oxygen requirement.  Given he was symptomatic, a\ndecision was made among his oncologists, thoracics and\ncardiology to perform pleurodesis in addition to pericardial\nwindow.  He was taken to the OR on  and underwent both\nprocedures.  Following pleurodesis the patient developed acute\nneurologic changes (#4). Postoperative CXR\n.\nThe pt. was seen by the medicine team and admitted for\nmanagement of pericardial effusion.  The cardiac team placed a\npericardial drain and the pt. was drained for the following 24\nhours.  The thoracic surgery team was consulted on HD 3 for\nmanagement of a recurrant right sided pleural effusion.  The pt.\nwas managed by the medical team as noted above.  On HD 6 the pt.\nwas taken to the OR for flexible bronchoscopy, hematoma\nevaluation, pericardial window, and pleurex catheter placement.\nWhile the patient was recovering in the PACU the pt. was noted\nto have unequal pupils and stopped following commands - that\nhe'd been inconsistently following earlier.  A code stroke was\ncalled, neurology evaluated the patient, and an emergent CT head\nas well as MRI/MRA were performed.  The CT showed no evidence of\nbleed or mass effect.  The MRI/MRA showed some evidence of small\nvessel disease but no abnormalities consistent with the pt.\nhaving had a stroke.  He was started on anti-seizure medications\nand transferred to the SICU for hourly neuro checks and further\nrecovery.  The patient slowly improved through the night of POD\n0 and by the morning of POD 1 was back to his baseline.  The\nneurology team evaluated the patient in the morning and per the\nattending, Dr. , it was felt the patient's neuro defecits\nas they were the prior evening were related to his recent\nsurgery and resulting transient metabolic changes.  On POD 2 the\npt. was transferred from the SICU to the floor, his chest tube\nwas removed and daily drainage of the pleurex catheter was\ninitiated.  While in the ICU the patient was also evaluated by\nthe Neurosurgery team for a 1.5mm aneurysm seen on the MRI ->\nthe pt. is to get a repeat CTA in 6 months for follow-up.\n.\nOver the next several days the patient underwent daily pleurex\ncatheter drainage -> tapering from Q8 hour drainage to q24 hour\ndrainage.  He was also seen by and worked with physical therapy\non a daily basis.  His diet was gradually increased to regular\nwith supplemental nutrition shakes.  His foley was removed on\nPOD 5 and he was voiding without difficulty prior to discharge.\nBecause of his further need for physical therapy the pt. was\nscreened for rehab and was ready for discharge on POD 7.  Prior\nto discharge the pt. was given instructions regarding follow-up\nappointments with the interventional pulmonology team, primary\ncare physician ,  medications, and\nactivity levels.  He received pleurex catheter care teaching\nwhile in house that shall continue while he is in rehab.  The\npatient understood these teachings and was ready for discharge.",

On hospital day 3, there was only comatose activity\nand his prognosis was guarded. However, the patient was able to\nbe weaned off the vent and over the course of the next three\ndays his mental status improved.  He was alert, oriented to\nplace and day of the week and moving all 4 extremities.  He\nbecame more interactive on transfer to the floor, was initially\nspeaking in spanish and English and not always making sense but\nthen started responding more appropiately and following\ncommands.  On hospital day 11 he had a witnessed grand mal\nseizure and was given ativan and started on Keppra with\nneurology consult.  His mental status was worse for 24 hours\nafter the seizure but then he slowly returned to his recent\nbaseline.  He was somewhat aggitated so his Keppra was switched\nto Topiramate. He had a subsequent seizure on  with LUE\ntonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but this\nresolved spontaneously after 1-2 minutes. He was contineud on\ntopamax per neuro recommendations. OT and PT were consulted and\nworked with the patient as he will likely require a long\nrehabilitation course.  At the time of discharge the patient was\nalert, oriented (though not always to date), following commands\nbut impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls.\n Neurology notes indicate the patient has the potential\ntoimprove from a neurologic standpoint.

In his first several days,\nhis respiratory status was comprimised by lobar collapse, first\nof the RUL and then of the RML. His extubation was initially\nlimited both by agitation requiring sedation and by requirements\nfor high PEEP to maintain oxygenation. His oxygenation was\nimproved with diuresis and agitation was better controlled with\nseroquel. He was extubated on  and respiratory status was\nstable.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "83 y/o Russian-speaking F h/o HTN, dementia, and 6 month-old\nsacral/coccygeal ulcer from a chemical burn presents with wound\ninfection.  The patient was admitted briefly to the floor and\nthen transferred to the intensive care unit with hypotension,\nleukocytosis, fever and bradycardia, likely representing sepsis.\n It was felt the most likely source was her wound infection.\nShe had a negative urinanalysis as well as a negative chest\nxray, showing no no evidence of pulmonary process.  Her EKG on\nadmission to the unit showed sinus bradycardia, no ST changes.\nThe patient was initially treated for adrenal insufficiency\ngiven her concurrent bradycardia, hyponatremia and borderline\nhyperkalemia.  She was fluid resuscitated, which stabilized her\nblood pressure and corrected her hyponatremia, making the cause\nlikely hypovolemic hyponatremia.\n.\nThe wound infection was initially treated with vancomycin,\naztreonam and clinda in the unit.  On HD1, coverage was changed\nfrom clinda to Flagyl, despite a listed allergy as there was no\nhistory of side effects while the patient was taking Flagyl.\nShe has tolerated the Flagyl while in the hospital without\ndifficulty.  Infectious disease was consulted for input on\nantibiotic management.  The patient had a MRI during this\nadmission to rule out osteomyelitis, which it did.  She is\ndischarged to complete a two week course of the above\nantibiotics per Infectious disease.  Plastic surgery was\nconsulted for wound care while the patient was in the ICU.  They\nperformed serial debridements throughout this hospital course.\nWound care was also involved in monitoring the progress of\nhealing.  The patient should follow up with plastics as needed\nfor wound care following discharge.\n.\nAlso while in the intensive care unit, the patient had short\nbursts of atrial fibrillation with RVR which broke\nspontaneously.  It was originally thought to be a tachy-brady\nsyndrome.  After transfer to the floor, EP was consulted.  It\nwas felt the patient most likely has PAF.  She was monitored on\ntelemetry with few episodes of tachycardia on the floor.  As she\nhas had an epidural hematoma while on coumadin, it was felt she\nis not a candidate for coumadin.  This decision was discussed\nwith her son  at the time.  Telemetry was discontinued and\nheart rate with routine vitals has been stable in the fifties to\nseventies.  The patient was started on low-dose aspirin for both\nstroke reduction and cardiac benefit.\n.\nThe patient has baseline anemia, likely caused by chronic\ndisease.  Her hematocrit has been stable throughout her\nhospitalization.  She was taking iron as an outpatient which was\nheld througout this course as she was having issues with\nconstipation.  The iron can be restarted once the patient is\nhaving regular bowel movements.\n.\nFor her depression and dementia the patient was continued on her\noutpatient medication regimen, including Celexa, Namenda and\nAricept.\n.\nHer anti-hypertensive was initially held in the setting of her\nhypotension.  She was restarted on her enalapril prior to\ndischarge, which she tolerated well.\n.\nThroughout her hospitalization, the patient benefited from\nhaving her family present for frequent reorientation (and given\nthat she is non-English speaking).\n.\nCONTACT:  , , HCP ()",

Please refer to previously\ndictated op note for details of this procedure.  Briefly, an\nintraabdominal abscess was found adjacent to a particularly\ninflamed region of the sigmoid colon.  This was promptly\ndrained, and a total colectomy with hartmann pouch & end\nileostomy was performed.  His 15 day postop course was\nrelatively complicated and can be summarized via organ systems\nas follows.\n\nNEURO: He continued his preop ativan for anxiety, but as his\npain improved, he required less anxiolysis & less narcotics.\n\nCV: Right bundle branch block.  1 intermittent episode of postop\natrial fibrillation.  He was rate controlled with lopressor,\nwhich was continued for periop cardiac protection.\n\nRESP: Preoperative pneumonia, which blossomed after surgery.  He\nimproved with double antibiotic coverage for pseudomonas.  He\ncurrently has O2 sats in the mid 90s on supplemental oxygen & he\nreceives neb treatments & advair.\n\nFEN: Still markedly over his baseline weight (70 kg), he is\nbeing maintained on a standing lasix dose.  This can be tapered\nonce he is more euvolemic.  His electrolytes should be checked\nregularly while on the lasix.  Nutritionally, he required TPN\nfor 10 postop days while awaiting stoma function.\n\nGI: The ostomy has been functional for several days now.  He has\ntolerated PO nutrition over the last few days without\ncomplication.  He should receive boost supplements TID to\nmaintain his caloric intake.  He is written for PPI for gastric\nprophylaxis while on his steroids.\n\nHEME: stable hct.  He is on DVT prophylaxis with SQ heparin.\nHis WBC of 15 on discharge is trending downward from the low 20s\nlast week.  No other issues.\n\nID: He finished a 2 week course of antibiotics for pseudomonal\npneumonia.  There had been a concern for a persistent abdominal\nprocess, given his high WBC & slow ostomy progression, but an\n CT scan was unremarkable.\n\nENDO: He was pulsed with high dose hydrocortisone\nperioperatively, and was weaned to current dose of 20mg\nprednisone without adrenal insufficiency.  He will be further\ntapered following his outpatient f/u with Dr .  He\nbriefly required IV insulin while on TPN & high dose steroids.\n\nDISPO: going to  Rehab Facility.  Full code.  HCP:\n  ()",

A D-dimer was within\nnormal limits, making PE unlikely, and he appeared euvolemic\nwith no history of heart failure and a normal BNP.  Pulmonary\nwas consulted and recommended a CT scan. CT scan on  showed\nprogression of his IPF, likely accounting for his symptoms of\nworsening DOE and his increased hypoxia with exertion.  His\nproviders at  were , and transfer was arranged to\npursue a 3-day in-patient transplant evaluation.  He was also\ncontinued on his home regimen of NAC TID.\n\n# Chest pain: The patient reports chest discomfort when short of\nbreath occasionally, however he has been experiencing this\nstablely for a long time.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION\nMs.  is a 66 year old female with hypertension (HTN),\nhyperlipidemia (HLD), osteoarthritis who presented with chest\npressure found to be due to inferolateral ST elevation\nmyocardial infarction (), with persistent hypotension after\nballoon inflation requiring dopamine.  She was weaned off the\ndopamine during the first 24 hours post-cath and remained stable\nhemodynamically and chest pain free.\n\nACTIVE PROBLEMS\n# - ST elevation in III greater than II, with ST depression\nin I, aVL suggested that right coronary artery was the culprit\nlesion. The patient had 3   placed in the RCA but still\nhad LCx 80% ostial OM1, 80% mid circumflex which was not treated\ngiven her hypotension (see below). In the cath lab, she was\nstarted on intregrillin which was continued for 12 hours and\nthen discontinued.  Her post-intervention echo showed preserved\nLV ejection fraction (60%) and no focal wall motion\nabnormalities.\n-New Medications:\n-Aspirin 81mg qday\n-Plavix 75mg po qday\n-Atorvastatin 80mg po qday\n-F/u the patient continues to have stenosis of the LCx and need\nfor intervention on this can be  addressed at follow-up with Dr.\n\n#Blood pressure control: While in the cath lab, the patient had\nhypotension after inflating the balloon in RCA.  Her right heart\ncath had normal pressures so a temporary vagal response was the\nmost likely etiology of her hypotension.  She was started on\ndopamine drip in the cath lab.  PCWP was 10, so slight\nhypovolemia may have contributed- patient received a total of\n1200 cc normal saline and was able to wean off dopamine drip\nwithin the first 24 hours.  She had no evidence of infection to\nsuggest sepsis as an etiology of hypotension.

With his improvement, he was transferred to\nthe floor on , with continued improvement of his LFT's.  An\nabd CT was not surprising, showing expected signs of\ninflammation around the liver.  Pt's abdominal pain was\nimproving on discharge.\n\nHypertension: in setting of acute hepatitis.  Pt was treated\nwith clonidine in house with.  Anticipate resolution with\nresolution of acute process.\n\n?Bipolar Disease/ADHD: Followed by psychiatry in house.  They\nrecommend not medically treating his reported diagnoses given pt\ncould not provide names of any psychiatrists, and the psychiatry\nteam questioned the pt's diagnoses.  Pt will follow up with\noutpatient psychiatry, and was given the number of a psychiatry\npractice near his home.\n\nLLL PNA: Likely due to aspiration while pt was acutely sick.  Pt\nspiked to 101.9, with evidence of LLL PNA on abd CT.  He was\nstarted on Levo/Flagyl  for 1 week.  He remained comfortable\non room air and afebrile.\n\n? H/O Seizures d/t subdural hemorrhage in setting of CVA in\n: Pt reported being on dilantin and depakote for\nseizures/mood stabalization.  However, I spoke with both his PCP\nand primary neurologist who have no record of him being on\neither medication, and no record of him ever having a seizure.\nFurther, he had an EEG for headaches on  that was normal.\n Pt's dilantin and depakote levels on admission were below\nassay.  Pt was not place on either dilantin or depakote.  He\nremained seizure free in house and head CT showed no evidence of\nsubdural hematoma as present three years ago after his car\naccident.  He will follow up with outpatient neurology.\n\nDrug seeking behavior: Pt was clearly pain med seeking, being\nverbally abusive to staff.

He spontaneously awoke without\ndeficits but was hypotensive requiring pressors. Likely cause of\narrest was increased vagal tone and cardiac stunning also\ncausing his persistent hypotension.  Dopamine and phenylepherine\ndrips were able to be quickly weaned and he remained\nnormotensive upon admission to the CCU and remained so overnight\ninto the day of discharge.\n.\n# RHYTHM: Pt came to the CCU in NSR after DCCV.  His rate\nremained 50s-60s overnight without major events on tele.  His\nflecanide was continued in house.  However, upon discharge the\ndecision was made to discontinue his flecanide along with his\nhome atenolol and quinapril given his borderline bradycardia and\nNSR.  He has follow up with PCP and cardiology at which point\nrestarting antiarrhytnmics can be discussed.  He was discharged\non his home coumadin regimen and should have INR checked per his\nnormal regimen.  He remained therapeutic on his coumadin\nin-house.\n.\n# Hct drop:  Pt was noticed to have a Hct drop from 43.7 on\nadmission to 33.3.  This was likely to be dilutional given his\nsignificant fluid resuscitation and comparable decrease in both\nhis WBC and platelet counts.  He was guaiac negative and denied\nany BRBRP or dark stools.  Repeat hct on the day of discharge\nwas stable at 33.9 so we did not feel there was any active\nbleed.  His hct should be followed up as an outpatient to ensure\nnormalization.\n.\n# Depression: Continued venlafaxine and lorazepam",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "41 yo F with newly diagnosed DLBCL in the neck, admitted to the\n for airway compromise.\n\n#Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Patient was transferred to the\n for airway protection after a large left sided neck mass\nwas noted on exam and on CT of the neck.  She was intubated on\n with ENT and anesthesia present for airway protection\ngiven the extrinsic compression from this mass as well as\nconcern for laryngeal edema.  The biopsy of the neck mass showed\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma and she was started on R-CHOP\ntherapy by the hematology/oncology team.  Her neck mass was\nmarkedly reduced in size with this intervention.  She was noted\nto have a cuff leak and was successfully extubated on ,\nagain with ENT and anesthesia present.  She was called out to\nthe BMT team for ongoing managent of her lymphoma.\n.\nShe was subsequently transfrred to the  a second time for\nworsening hoarseness and dysphagia after extubation.  She had a\nCT neck on  which showed no airway compromise and\nmarkedly improved edema compared to the prior study.  She was\nalso seen by ENT who also say no evidence of airway compromise\nduring laryngoscopy.  Her symptoms remained stable and she was\ntransferred back to the floor.\n.\nShe remained stable on the floor and received a second cycle of\nCHOP. Her pain improved as the mass continued to recede. She was\ndischarged home with close Heme/Onc follow up.\n.\n# TMJ: She complained of significant left ear pain. ENT was\nconsulted and felt her pain was most consistent with TMJ\ndysfunction. She was put on jaw rest with a pureed diet and\nprescription Oxycodone was provided at the time of discharge.\n.\n#Pneumonia: There was an equivocal LLL infiltrate on her CXR and\nthe decision was made to treat her for pneumonia given that she\nwas to be started on chemotherapy and would be immunosuppressed.\n She was treated with vanc and Zosyn for an 8 day course.\nSputum culture was negative during this admission.\n.\n# UTI: Pt complained of dysuria and UA revealed UTI. Cultures\ngrew pan sensitive E Coli and she was given a 5d course of\nCiprofloxacin.\n.\n# Hypothyroidism\nContinued on levothyroxine.\n.\n# Crohns disease\nContinued asacol (held while intubated)\n.\n# Seizure disorder\nContinued trileptal\n.\n# Depression/anxiety\nContinued seroqual and clonazepam.\n.\n# HTN\nContinued clonidine\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Patient has endorsed decreased hearing in\nher left ear, likely due to compression from the mass. She will\nneed an audiology assessment as an outpatient. She was afebrile\nand HD stable at the time of discharge. She will follow up with\nHeme/Onc within 5d of discharge.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "30 yo male with HTN, hypokalemia, CKDIII, h/o untreated positive\nPPD presents with few days abdominal pain that has now resolved\nwith 2-3 months weight loss, bilateral leg edema, anorexia found\nto have anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure,\nhypoalbuminemia, symmetric diffuse lymphadenopathy and volume\noverload with exam suggestive of acute diastolic heart failure.\nConcerned for neoplastic and, chronic inflammatory, or\ninfectious processes.\n.\n# Acute diastolic heart failure: He was noted to be in acute\ndiastolic heart failure on transfer from the ICU. He was given\nlasix 40 mg iv x 1, and continued on a 20 mg iv daily regimen,\nthen was transitioned to 40mg PO daily. Daily weights and I/O's\nwere followed. His blood pressure was controlled as below; in\nparticular, he was started on beta blocker, resumed on an ACEI\n(which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy), and started\non spironolactone as well. His O2 requirement was weaned off.\n.\n# Hypoalbuminemia: possibly renal or primary GI. Nothing on\nhistory to suggest primary GI protein losing enteropathy though\nthis should be considered (i.e. celiac sprue, lymphoma, IBD,\namyloid etc.) especially in light of improving renal function\nwhich argues against primary renal protein loss, low albumin,\nabsence of known liver disease and weight loss. SPEP/UPEP\nnegative. Anti-TTG IgA negative. Pt should discuss need for\ncolonoscopy with his PCP given anemia, weight loss and age.\n.\n# Gram positive bacteremia, unclear source: He was initially\nstarted on vanc, but this was d/c'd when this culture latered\nspeciated with coagulase negative staph. No subsequent cultures\nhad growth.\n.\n#non-specific enteritis-seen on CT scan. This likely explains\nreports of abdominal pain and diarrhea recently. Pt's abdominal\npain resolved. He did not have diarrhea and stool studies were\nnegative. Symptoms resolved and pt was tolerating a regular\ndiet.\n.\n# Weight Loss - 25-30lb. Large DDx. Concerning for primary\nneoplastic vs. GI-infectious vs. GI/systemic infectious. See\nabove. Nothing on history/exam to suggest primary rheumatologic\ndisorder, ESR 13,  negative. He was scheduled for a lymph\nnode biopsy (his R inguinal lymph node seemed the largest),\nexcisional by surgery. However, he refused this. Contact legal\nguardian   as well as PCP regarding this issue. Pt\ninitially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes. However,\nlater on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymph\nnodes was to look for \"cancer\" and then stated that he would\nnever have a biospy. Discussed this with patient's PCP and legal\nguardian who did not want to force (by physical or chemical\nrestraint) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will.\nDiscussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple times\nand he did decline, but agrees to follow up with his PCP for\nfurther evaluation.\n.\n# Acute Renal Failure w/ proteinuria: Lack of schistocytes on\ninitial smear argued against TTP etiology. Likely pre-renal,\nperhaps due to poor po intake. unclear if he was hypotensive in\nthe ED. FENa suggested prerenal etiology. Creatinine improved to\nbaseline. He should have chemistries/electrolytes followed after\ndischarge. Creatinine on discharge 1.6.\n.\n# Altered mental status, from opiates received in the ED now\nresolved. He was initially admitted to the ICU given his\nunresponsiveness after opiates. This resolved after being given\nnarcan and never reoccurred.\n.\n# Anemia - His B12, folate, and iron were normal. Smear was\nchecked in ICU and only rare schistocytes were seen. HIV Ab was\nnegative. His hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 30.1\non day of discharge without evidence of bleeding. This is likely\ndue CKD. However, given recent abdominal pain and anemia pt\nshould undergo a colonoscopy.\n.\n# Thrombocytopenia - He was found to have thrombocytopenia,\nthought to be subacute, given that he had 130K one month ago.\nHis platelets were monitored and normalized. Splenomegaly not\nnoted on imaging. HIV negative. Could have been due to\nmedications or acute illness.\n.\n# Ascites - new finding. Had not been tapped b/c ICU felt not\ntappable. No known chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.\nConsidered lymphoma, occult cirrhosis, TB peritonitis on\ndifferential given +PPD, abdominal pain, weight loss. TB\nenteritis normal affects IC valve area which he does not\nradiographically/clinically have. RUQ US was without significant\nascites, not enough to tap; no cirrhosis noted. This could be\ndue to heart failure, but is likely due to low albumin.\nQuantiferon gold PENDING at time of discharge.\n.\n# Hypertension - He was continued on his home regimen, although\nit was found that he wasn't filling these prescriptions as an\noutpt. Given proteinuria, he was (re-)started on an ACE-I. He\nwas also started on spironolactone given his heart failure and\nhypertension (after drawing renin and aldosterone). He was\nstarted on beta blocker given dCHF.\n- With chronic hypokalemia, sent renin / aldosterone levels\nsince these have never been sent, to rule out\nhyperaldonsteronism. These are still PENDING at time of\ndischarge.\n.\n# Hypokalemia- see above, concern for hyperaldo. Repleted dialy.\nPt started on spironolactone and still required supplementation\nof potassium. Suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by\n given CKD and use of spironolactone. Pt should have his\npotassium checked regularly.\n.\n# Lymphadenopathy - bilateral inguinal and axillary. He denied\nfevers and chills, but noted weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, ahnd\nelevated LDH,  suggested biopsy to r/o TB, lymphoma (with flow\ncytommetry), etc.  Surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of LN,\nbut pt refused. Pt refused on multiple occasions. See above. PCP\nand legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo procedures\nand testing that he did not want. Pt was aware that biopsy was\nsuggested to r/o cancer.\n.\n# Positive PPD (untreated) - CXR was performed without note of\ntuberculous disease INH is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency.\n.\n# Pericardial Effusion - likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia.\nMild per ECHO (not large as reported on CT), no signs of\ntamponade. Other DDx = TB (though usually much larger), other\nRheum disorders (unlikely by hx/exam). This was likely due to\nhypoalbumenemia.\n.\n# Long QT: Present also on EKG . His potassium was\nrepleted. QTC remained ~440 with haldol dosing. Serial EKG were\nperformed. Pt's haldol dose was decreased to 5mg from 10mg due\nto this. EKG's should be monitored in outpatient setting.\n.\n# Lacunar infarct, clincally quiescent: Seen on head CT, and new\n\nsince . Would recommend outpatient workup for PFO, etc.\n.\n# Psych: schizophrenia, formerly pleasant did become\ninexplicably agitated about prospect of getting LN biopsy. Pt\nfound to lack capacity by psychiatry and found to have a legal\nguardian- . Pt's guardian was updated on pt's\nclinical course and as above did not want to pursue restraints\n(physical/chemical) in order to enforce biopsy. Pt was taken off\nhis depakote during admission given altered mental status and\nthis should be resumed upon discharge. Pt's haldol was decreased\nto 5mg from 10mg given above. Pt remained pleasant throughout\nthe remainder of the hospitalization.\n.\nTransitional items for follow up\n1.EKG monitoring for QTC\n2.follow renal function and electrolytes given recent\nARF/hypokalemia\n3.f/u labs still pending at time of discharge quantiferon gold,\nrenin/aldosterone, histoplasma antigen\n4.consider colonoscopy\n5.consider lymph node biopsy\n6.lasix dose titration prn\n.\nDVT PPx: Heparin SC\n.\nLines: PIV\n.\nCODE: FULL",

Hypoattenuation in the bilateral periventricular white matter\nmay be sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease but\nhas progressed from  and is greater than expected in this\nage group.\n.\nEKG: NSR, rate 69, LVH, borderline LAD, inverted T waves in V-V4,\nbiphasic T waves in V5. (changed from prior)\n.\nTTE The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.\nThe right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right\nventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free\nwall function. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic\nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is\nnot present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small\npericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of\ntamponade.\n.\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of , the degree of LVH is now moderate.\nThere is now a very small pericardial effusion (without\ntamponade).\n.\nCXR : Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung\nvolumes. Pulmonary edema is mild-to-moderate, has worsened.\nBilateral pleural effusions are small and new or newly apparent.\n\n.\nRUQ US : IMPRESSION: Initial four quadrant ultrasound did\nnot demonstrate enough free fluid for paracentesis. This\nsuggests that prior ascites may have shifted. Note is also made\nof sludge in the gallbladder with nonobstructive non-shadowing\nsmall stones.

To further evaluate etiology of\ncirrhosis, patient was tested for qualitative HCV to determine\nlow levels of HCV, alpha 1 antitrypsin, and Hepatitis B PCR,\nwhich were still pending as of discharge. During the admission,\npatient had greatly increased ascites resulting in stomach\ndiscomfort and nausea. For initial treatment of ascites, patient\nwas started on diuretic therapy on  with spironolactone\nand furosemide.\n.\n3) Klebsiella Bacteremia\nDuring this admission, patient was found to have blood culture\npositive for pansensitive Klebsiella and treated with\nlevofloxicin for 2 weeks. Patient has been afebrile for the\nlength of his stay and surveillance blood cultures have been\nnegative.\n.\n4) Ileus\nPatient also developed an ileus on  with greatly\ndistended bowel, abdominal discomfort, and shortness of breath\nwhich resolved with enemas and NGT placement. Patient slowly\nprogressed from being NPO to a regular diet.\n.\n5) Shortness of Breath:\nPatient developed acute shortness of breath during admission\nsecondary to bilateral PEs confirmed on CTA. Patient was\nanticoagulated with IV heparin drip and then converted to\nlovenox. Patient's SOB was further compounded with abdominal\ndistension secondary to ileus and fluid overload. Patient was\ndischarged with lovenox and will be converted to coumadin at\noutpatient.\n.\n6)Lactic acidosis:\nPatient's lactic acidosis was likely secondary to reduced\ncardiac output in hypotension and quickly resolved after\ntransfer from MICU to floor.\n.\n7) Diabetes mellitus:\nPatient presented with elevated sugars on admission which was\ncorrected and then remained under control with insulin sliding\nscale.\n.\n8) Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "65 year old female admitted to the acute care service after a\nfall in which she sustained left sided rib fractures.  Upon\nadmission, she was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and the\nPain service was consulted for placement of an epidural catheter\nfor analgesic control of rib pain.\n\nOn HD #1,  she was admitted to the trauma intensive care unit\nfor placement of a thoracic epidural catheter for pain control.\nA foley catheter was also placed.  Because of her history of\nETOH, she was placed on a CIWA scale. Her rib pain was\ncontrolled but she continued to have episodes of desaturation.\nShe was encouraged to use the incentive spirometer and her\noxygen saturations improved.  She was transferred to the\nsurgical floor on HD #3.\n\nShe was transferred to the trauma intensive care unit on HD #4\nwith shortness of breath. A chest x-ray did show a fluid\ncollection and a chest tube was placed for a hemothorax of\n700cc.  Her respiratory status improved with placement of the\nchest tube.  During this time, she also had episodes of\nconfusion which were thought to be related to her narcotic\nanalgesia.  Her mental status cleared once her narcotics were\ndiscontinued. She did require 2 units of PRBC for a hematocrit\nof 22.  After the transfusion, her hematorcrit increased to 30.\n\n\nShe was transferred to the surgical floor on HD #5.  At this\ntime, her chest tube was placed to water seal and she maintained\nadequate oxygenation.  She was encouraged to use the incentive\nspirometer.   She was evaluated by physical therapy and she\ndemonstrated functional mobility necessary for discharge home.\n\nHer chest tube was discontinued on HD # 9 and she had a chest\nx-ray done after removal. Her vital signs are stable and she is\nafebrile.  She is tolertating a regular diet.  She has been\nambulating without any shortness of breath.\n\nThe social worker has been in to visit and provided with options\nfor additional counselling upon discharge. Home safety issues\nwere addressed and patient reportedly feels comfortable with her\nspouse.\n\nShe is preparing for discharge to her daughter's home.  She will\nfollow up with the acute care service in 3 weeks.  She has been\ninstructed that she is not allowed to fly for 1 month.\n\nOf note:  your chest x-ray did show multifocal, nondependent\nground-glass opacities, predominantly in the right lung.  Your\nprimary care provider   on this.  Acute care\nclinic called on  and informed that patient will need a\ncopy of discharge summary to bring to her primary care provider.",

ACS\nruled out by neg EKG, enzymes, and poor story for angina. Pt was\nalso found to be in severe acute dCHF with frank anasarca. MRI\nof chest/abdomen was negative for dissection and PE, however\npoor image quality and heparin was continued. Initial echo\nshowed mild to moderate pericardial effusion, which, on repeat\necho, was worsening, associated with wider pulsus paradoxus (see\nbelow). Please see below, ultimately it was felt that her chest\npain was a result of recurrent pericarditis. She was treated\nwith colchicine and PO hydromorphone with good response.\n.\n# Pericarditis and pericardial effusion:  Patient was found to\nhave pulsus paradoxus and tamponade physiology on echo.  She\nunderwent pericardiocentesis on . Post-pericardiocentesis,\nthe patient was transferred to CCU for close monitoring.  She\nintermittently continued to experience left sided, pleuritic\nchest pain, requiring opioids for adequate relief. Repeat\nbedside TTEs daily x 2 days following pericardiocentesis\nrevealed only trivial pericardial effusion.  Pericardial drain\nwas pulled on .  Given patient's multiple allergies,\nincluding to NSAIDS, patient was put on colchicine for\npericarditis.  On transfer back to the floor on , patient's\nchest pain was better controlled. Workup for etiology of\npericardial effusion included negative RF and . dsDNA is\npending.  Furthermore, patient had no viral prodrome prior to\nadmission.

Given patient is\nguaiac positive, concern for GI bleed if HCT dropping rapidly,\nhowever pt is having her period, and HCTs have been stable.\nPatient did not require any transfusion during this admission.\n.\n# Chronic Kidney Disease: Likely HTN and DM induced. Baseline\nbetween 1.2 and 2.0. She had acute kidney injury with Cr to 2.3\nin the setting of diuresis and tamponade likely causing prerenal\nkidney injury.  Diuretics were held then gently restarted on a\nlower dose (40 mg daily from 80 mg ) at discharge.\n.\n# DM: Pt with elevated BS on admission, no gap.  Home regimen of\n50units of glargine and ISS were continued.\n.\n# HTN: Patient's home regimen was continued with reasonable\ncontrol of blood pressure.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin was switched to pravastatin after\ncolchicine was started to redue the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\n.\n# Psych: Citalopram and clonazepam were continued per outpatient\nregimen.\n\nThe patient received a diabetic/heart healthy/low salt diet.\nShe received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

ECG showed lateral ST-changes. Continued\non heparin and plavix loaded. On the floor pt denied CP, SOB. Pt\ninitially refused catheterization fearing it might lead to\naccelerated need for hemodialysis. After several conversations\nw/ attending physician,  weighed risks and benefits of\nprocedure and agreed to proceed. Pt appeared overloaded prior to\nprocedure, and received 60 IV lasix X 2 with good urine output.\nHe was still mildly volume positive before catheterization,\njudged to be acceptable in the setting of ESRD. He received left\nheart catheterization , revealing signficant disease with\ncomplicated lesions in his LAD and LCx. However, he received a\nlarge amount of dye and his case was aborted given the desire to\navoid the need for hemodialysis given his ESRD.\n\nThe patient remained chest pain free between his diagnostic cath\n and therapeutic cath  on maximal medical regimen\nincluding heparin gtt (48 hrs) ASA 325mg, plavix, metoprolol and\nstatin.\n\nOn , the patient had a DES to Ramus and DES to LCx/OM2. He\n the procedure well. He has follow-up with his\noutpatient cardiologist Dr.  in the coming weeks.\n\nESRD.\n\nPt had AVF placed six months prior to this admission, and\nrevision two weeks prior. Pt desires transplant and expressed\nstrong wish to postpone dialysis as long as possible. Renal\nconsulted for management of catheterization in setting of ESRD;\nrecommended simultaneous hydration and diuresis. Unfortunately\nafter cath , patient creatinine began to rise from 3.5 to\n8.8, necessitating urgent dialysis. Unfortunately, the patient's\nAV fistula was still too immature for use and a tunnel catheter\nwas placed . Mr   dialysis well and went for\nsubsequent treatments after his second cardiac cath . He has\nbeen discharged with outpatient dialysis MWF, which he will\nlikely require long term. He also has outpatient follow up with\nthe transplant service.\n\nDirty UA with positive Urine culture\nThe patient had a dirty UA and a positive urine culture that\ngrew Klebsiella. The patient was asymptomatic. He completed a 7\nday course of ciprofloxacin while in house.\n\nDepression\nWhile in house, the patient had passive suicidal ideations and a\ndepressed mood. He was seen by psychiatry, who recommended long\nterm therapy and medication. The patient refused both. The\npsychiatry team spoke with the  health care proxy and\nsister in law, who felt the patient was not safe at home with a\nfirearm. Psych had the local police department (for whom the\npatient used to work) confiscate Mr  firearm from his\nhome. The patient denies any homicidal or suicidal ideations at\ndischarge.\n\nAnemia\nThe patient appeared to have anemia from iron deficiency and\nchronic kidney disease. Guaiac of stools was negative. He was\nkept on PO iron and also received EPO treatments at dialysis.\n\nPast Hx of Fournier's Gangrene c/b bowel resection.\nThe patient had no active issues with his ostomy site.\n\nDiabetes\nThe patient had 2 episodes of AM hypoglycemia. His basal insulin\ndose was decreased and his bolus doses were increased to limit\npost-prandial hyperglycemia.\n\nTransitional Issues\n\nThe patient is confirmed DNR/DNI\n\nHe will continue to follow up with Nephrology at dialysis. He\nalso has an appointment with the transplant team. The patient's\nfistula should continue to be monitored to determine when it\nwill be mature enough for use. Hopefully, he will not need the\ntunnel catheter for a prolonged period of time.\n\nCardiologist Dr  will monitor for symptoms of angina\npost-cath.

She also noted 65 lb weight loss since\nthis summer with polydipsia and polyuria. She noted a 2 day hx\nof fatigue and SOB and ran out of metformin 3 days prior to\nadmissioan dn did not get this refilled. Three days ago she ran\nout of her Metformin and did not get it filled. She denied any\nlocalising sx for infection by had slightly decreased PO intake\nfrom her recent dysphagia and felt dehydrated. There was\nevidence of rare bacteria on UA and no dysuria, CXR was clear.\nThe precipitant was felt to be likely medication noncompliance.\nLabs on admission revealed Glc 513 Cl 94 HCO3 7 An Gap 35 and UA\npos for ketones.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "A/P 39 yo male with relapsed Hodgkins Disease on CEPP chemo, w/\nSVC syndrome here for TPA infusion via portocath.\n\n1. SVC syndrome - The patient was admitted to the ICU. He was\nstarted on a heparin drip. He had an infusion of low dose TPA\nwith no change in fibrinogen or INR but the follow up venogram\nshowed some residual clot. He then underwent mechanical removal\nwith the Possis angiojet and suction thrombectomy of about 80%\nof this clot. There was some residual clot but there was free\nflow in the superior vena cava so it was left. He was maintained\non heparin gtt and transferred to the floor.  He was started on\ncoumadin in addition to the heparin, but after several days of\nuptitrating the dose, he still remained subtherapeutic. He\nremained clinically stable during this time, so the decision was\nmade to switch him to lovenox so he could be discharged. He was\nmaintained on heparin for several hours after starting lovenox,\nthen his heparin was stopped. He was d/cd to home after the case\nmanager assured that his insurance would cover part of the\nlovenox.\n.\n2. Hodgkins Lymphoma- The patient recently finished his second\ncycle of CEPP. A repeat PET was done on  which showed\npossible new disease in the LUL and stable disease in the RL. A\nfollow up CT showed multiple right pulmonary nodules with\nnodular areas of pleural thickening, but no new disease in the\nLUL. At that point, it was decided to send the patient home with\nno further chemotherapy and to consider harvesting the patient\nfor an autologous stem cell transplant instead of doing the 3rd\ncycle of CEPP.\n\n3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several\nnodular areas - most likely c/w Hodgkins Lymphoma as present\nsince  despite several trials of antibiotics. Since\nthe patient was neutropenic and having fevers, a possible new\npneumonia could not be ruled out. He was started on\ncefepime/vanco and then when he was no longer neutropenic, the\ncefepime was changed to levofloxacin. All of his antibiotics\nwere then stopped when he became afebrile. The RUL consolidation\npersisted on follow up CT and was felt to be c/w HL.\n\n4. Pain control- The pt has bilateral leg pain from\nchemotherapy. In the ICU, the pain was managed w/ short acting\noxycodone because they wanted to follow his MS during the tpa\ninfusion. Once he was transferred to the floor, he was started\non oxycontin twice a day with oxycodone for breakthrough. His\noxycontin was titrated upt to 40 mg  with oxycodone for\nbreakthrough for optimal pain control. He was discharged on this\nregimen.\n.\n4. Prophylaxis- The patient was anticoagulated throughout the\nadmission for his SVC clot. He was also maintained on colace and\nsenna while on narcotics.\n.\n5. Code status- Full Code\n.\n6.

Mr.  was also started on an Ace\ninhibitor, initially captopril so we could uptitrate it and then\nswitched to lisinopril. He was also started on a beta blocker\nwhich was changed to Toprol XL upon discharge. His cardiac\nenzymes peaked on HD #2 (CK 1356, MB 159, index 11.7, troponin\n4.37). Pt was counselled regarding smoking cessation, as well as\neducated from nutrition consult regarding a cardiac diet.\n\nb.

His electrolytes were\nchecked and potassium was found to be 3.1, magnesium 1.7. Those\nwere repleted. He was also started on his beta blocker then.\nBecause he continued to have NSVT, he was amiodarone loaded IV.\nAmio was d/cd on HD #2 as NSVT was likely from ischemia in the\nsetting of MI.

Patient reported\nhaving several bowel movements per day, greater than 5 in 24\nhour period. Therefore he was started on Loperamide and\ninstructed to titrate his bowel movements to 3 per day. In\nregards to his surgical incision the erythema was receding and\nwe were unable to express any drainage. However, he reported\nmild tenderness on palpation at surgical site. Antibiotics were\ndeferred at this time due to receding erythema and no fevers.\nPatient was instructed to continued to monitor his incision site\nfor worsening erythema and purulent drainage. His pain was well\ncontrolled on oral pain medication. He was discharged home in\ngood condition with follow-up instructions.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "A 36-year-old man with history of GHB abuse, previous crystal\nmeth use, HIV, asthma, and MRSA pneumonia who presented to the\nED with chest pain, SOB, tachycardia, headache, and extreme\nanxiety in the setting of GHB abuse.\n\nGHB withdrawal: He arrived tachycardic, hypertensive, and\ndiaphoretic. Urine and blood tox screen were negative on\nadmission. The toxicology service was consulted in the ED and\nrecommended phenobarbital for control of GHB withdrawal\nsymptoms, with benzos as 2nd line if ineffective.  In the ICU,\nhe was started on a regimen of phenobarbital 30mg TID\n(long-acting) with valium 5-10mg PRN for anxiety in between\ndosing.  Both of these meds were initially given IV, but were\ntransitioned to PO overnight.  Since rhabomyolysis is a risk of\nGHB withdrawal, CKs were checked and IVF continued at 200cc/hr\ninitially without any change in renal function.  EKG did not\nshow any QRS or QT prolongation or ST changes indicative of\nischemia.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Social work had been\nconsulted, the patient was discharged with a cab to the BEST\nteam to help with placement, as per the BEST team and SW this\nwas the most likely way the patient would be able to find\nplacement somewhere for a detox facility.   His adderall was\nheld during this acute withdrawal period. Toxicology team saw\nhim and recommended a Phenobarbital taper as instructed on\nmedication sheet.  He can re-initiate his Adderall following\ncessation of his withdrawal symptoms, he has mild withdrawal as\nevidenced by anxiety at the time of discharge.\n\nPersonality disorder with externalizing style.  Patient blames\nothers for bad treatment, takes little responsibility for\nhimself.  This is consistent with prior documented visits with\nother health care workers.\n\nARF: Creatinine 1.0 on admission from recent baseline of 0.6 to\n0.7.  This resolved to 0.8 the following morning after IVF\nhydration.\n\nHIV: CD4 count 479 and he was continued on\nemtricitabine-tenofovir, atazanavir, and ritonavir.  These were\nconfirmed with his  outpatient records. There was\notherwise no evidence of bacterial infection.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr.  is a 75 YOM with ESRD on HD, paraplegia with chronic\nindwelling foley catheter who presented from OSH with mental\nstatus changes, found to have seizure activity eventually made\nCMO on the floor expiring on \n#. Altered mental status,  delirium and post-ictal state.\nDelirium is likely  infectious etiology (see below).  He was\ninitially noted to be very agitated and combative, attmpting to\npull out his HD line, colostomy bag and chronic indwelling Foley\ncatheter, requiring restraints (pharmacologic and 2-point), on\narrival.  Initially patient was covered empirically for\nmeningitis, infected decubitus ulcer, UTI, and ? osteomyelitis\n(but most likely chronic) upon arrival to the hospital although\ncultures were unrevealing.  He was started on vancomycin,\nceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir.  He underwent LP with\nCSF that was negative but had gross blood.  CT head without\ncontrast did not show intracranial hemorrhage.  He could not\nundergo MRI because of hardware.  Ampicillin was discontinued as\nCSF bacterial culture was negative.  Subsequently, he was\nswitched to HAP/aspiration pneumonia coverage as his culture\nresults return and developed more respiratory symptoms.\nAcyclovir was stopped as HSV PCR returned negative.  His altered\nmental status only improved slightly but never back to baseline\nper his family members.   was later noted to have seizure\nactivities, which likely explain part of his somnolence toward\nthe later part of his hospital course.  Of note, his TSH, B12,\nand RPR were wnl.  He was ultimately made CMO in the MICU,\ntherefore, prompting discontinuation of all antibiotics as well\nas dialysis.  A morphine drip was started on the floor on ,\nand the patient expired on .\n\n#. Seizure.  New.  ? metabolic/infectious vs. new intracranial\nlesions not detected by non-contrast CT head.  There was initial\nquestion of seizure from the OSH.  However, patient did well in\nthe beginning of hospital course without signs of seizure, but\ndid have an episode of right arm rigidity and decreased\nresponsiveness, prompting neurology consult and initial EEG\nmonitoring.  Later on , patient was noted to have left\n eye deviation with nystagmus with involuntary tonic clonic\nmovement of his head and neck.  He received IV Ativan with\nimprovement.  Neurology was called to the bedside, and patient\nwas subsequently placed on continuous EEG monitoring and\nDilantin loading.  By , additional seizure activities\nwere witnessed by EEG as well as observation while he was in\ndialysis.  Lacosemide was added to his antiepileptic regimen,\nand he was switched to fosphenytoin.  His antiepileptic\nmedications were switched to IV and were dosed renally.  Per EEG\nreport, after loading of the dilantin and lacosemide, seizure\nactivities decreased.  He was later transferred to the MICU for\nclose monitoring given hypoxia, which could be  underlying\nseizure activities.  Discussion was held with family with\nregarding to having patient undergo contrast CT given unclear\netiology of his new seizure.  However, the family deferred on CT\nhead with contrast.  He could not undergo MRI given hardware in\nhis back.  While in the MICU, despite familys decision to\ntransition to CMO, patient was kept on antiepileptic medications\nfor comfort.  As above, he was started on a morphine drip on the\nfloor and subsequently expired\n\n#. Hospital acquired pneumonia/Aspiration pneumonia.  This was\nnoted on , a day after placement of the NGT.  NGT was\nplaced in the setting of patient's refusal to take any po meds,\nfood, and uncontrolled HTN on IV antihypertensives.  Previous\nCXR was not convincing for pneumonia in the setting of negative\npulmonary symptoms and signs.  Antibiotics were readjusted to\nvancomycine, cefepime, and Flagyl to cover fro HAP and\naspiration pneumonia.  He was later noted to be hypoxic on RA,\nleading to a trigger on .  He was placed on NRB, but was\nunable to be weaned.  Family was informed.  Patient was\ntransferred to the MICU for more concern of hypoxia in the\nsetting of pneumonia and seizure, requiring more intensive\nmonitoring, but patient was DNR/DNI.  He was suctioned, and\ncopious amount of sputum was removed with improvement of his\noxygenation.  He was able to be weaned to 3L NC upon return to\nthe floor, although by that time, the family has decided that he\nshould be CMO.  Therefore, antibiotics were discontinued upon\nhis return to the floor on .\n\n#.  Hypoxia.  This was noted on  during the trigger\nduring which patient was trigger.  It was concerning in the\nsetting of HAP/Aspiration pneumonia in the setting of possible\npersistent seizure.  Patient was transferred to the MICU with\nNRB.  He was suctioned with improvement.  He was weaned to 3L NC\nprior to transfer to the floor.  Abx, however, were stopped\ngiven his CMO status upon return to the floor on , and\nthe patient subsequently expired as above.\n\n#.  Upper GI bleeding.  After patient was in MICU, he was noted\nto have + bloody secretion from the NGT.  Aspiration showed\nblood.  He did not receive any blood product while in the MICU.\nHis Hct trended down but then stabilized.  His ASA and Plavix\nwere discontinued given persistent slow ooz.  It is most likely\nthis is  stress ulcer.  He continued to have very small\namount of melanic output from his ostomy bag.  NGT was removed\nprior to return from the MICU given CMO status, and pt expired\nas abovee.\n\n#.  Hypertension,  inadequate control with IV\nantihypertensives.  His SBP was consistently in the 180s-200s\nduring the initial part of his hospital course as he refused to\ntake any oral medications in the setting of delirium.  IV\nlabetolol, IV hydralazine, and his routine dialysis could not\ncontrol his HTN.  Medical team was concern for his risk of\nintracranial bleeding in the setting of uncontrolled SBP, so an\nNGT was placed on .  Once his regular oral\nantihypertensives were administered, his SBP improved to the\n130s-140s, which per his PCP was his baseline.  However, his\nantihypertensives were discontinued after his family\ntransitioned him to CMO, and subsequently expired as above on\n.\n\n#.  Sinus tachycardia.  Most likely  acute inflammatory\nprocess mentioned above and hyperactive delirium.  He recieved\nIVF initially prior to the NGT placement for possible\ndehydration.  See above for treatments\n\n#.  Nutrition.  He received D5 1/2 NS initially until NGT was\nplaced.  Then, he received a brief periods of tube feed, until\nseizure activities were noted.  He was kept NPO after seizures\nwere observed, to prevent further aspiration.\n\n#. Elevated troponin and CK.  EKG showed peaked T wave but no ST\nchanges other than prominent J points in precordial leads.  CKMB\nflat.  ? recent NSTEMI as he does have history of CAD with stent\nin RCA (per PCP  covering physician .  ).\nPossibly from ? seizure in OSH or straining against the\nrestraints.  Cardiology consult thought this is  ESRD and\nalso in the setting of sinus tachycardia.  He was initially kept\non ASA, Plavix, home statin, and antihypertensives until UGIB\nand transition to CMO.\n\n#. Hyperkalemia.  Noted on initial presentation.  Likely in the\nsetting of ESRD needing HD.\n\n#. ESRD on HD. T/Th/Sat.  Newly initiated HD this year with\ntunneled catheter.  He was followed closely by nephrology.\n2-point restraints were placed to prevent self-removal of HD\nline.  He was kept on home meds when with NGT in place as he had\nrefused all po meds prior to NGT placements.  During MICU stay,\nhis HCPs decided to transition patient to CMO with\ndiscontinuation of his dialysis.\n\n#. Stage 3 decubitus ulcers.  In bilateral ischial as well as\ntronchateric sites.  Wound nurse   and thought that\nthese are chronic wounds without significant signs of infection,\nalthough wounds are deep enough to possibly cause osteomyelitis\n(could not be evaluated as he has + hard  for MRI, and bone\nscan was not pursued due to other more likely infectious\nsources).  Pain medication was administered prior to dressing\nchange each day.  He continued to receive wound care for\ncomfort.",

Hypotension most likely  to sepsis but could\nrepresent cardiogenic shock possible  to AMI. AS likely\nfurther contributing to patient's inability to maintain\nappropriate cardiac output. He was initially maintained on\nLevophed, now off since 0200 on . A cosyntropin stim test\nshowed minimal response, 30.5-> 29.7-> 32.9, so hydrocortisone\n50 mg q6 started . Urine with CNS > 100,000 colonies of\nSA, sensitive to oxacillin, but continuing Vanc/Zosyn until\nother cultures have incubated at least 72 hrs before narrowing\ncoverage.

Patient was\nconversing with family members day of admissioon and was no\nlonger responding to voice on MICU transfer. Also had bilateral\nupper and lower extremity weakness. There was some concern for\nspinal artery infarction at the OSH. MS changes could be  to\nencephalopathy from sepsis, renal failure. Could also be  to\nacute stroke, cord infarct, or cord compression. No evidence of\nseizure activity. Neuro was consulted and MRI/MRA head, Cspine,\nTspine showed stroke, likely embolic, in cerebellum, cortex,\nbrainstem, Cspine, Tspine.\n.\n*Hypoxia: Patient's O2 sats had been stable on NC O2. This AM\nsats dropped to the low 90s on 6L NC and patient was initially\ntransitioned to NRB. Lungs sounded rhonchorous bilaterally and\nit was thought this was  to volume overload or infectious\nprocess. Patient then became bradycardic and respirations\nappeared labored, so he was intubated. Source likely pulmonary\nedema in the setting of renal failure and AS. Right-side\npneumothorax detected on CXR; thoracic surgery placed chest tube\nto suction. CXR with small R PTX, likely aspiration infiltrate\nin LLL. Although he woke up enough to open eyes and move his\ntongue, he did not breath over the vent when sedation was\nlightened.\n.\n*Renal Failure: Patient's UOP dropped acutely following\npresentation in the setting of hypotension. Pt has chronic renal\ninsufficiency, but urine lytes c/w pre-renal etiology of ARF. Cr\nelevated to 5 and UOP continued to be low.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr.  is a 59 year old male with non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis listed for transplant who was\nadmitted for increasing abdominal distention and weight gain,\nand possible cellulitis.  He developed NSTEMI in the setting of\na paracentesis and underwent cardiac catheterization with\nplacement of bare metal stent (BMS) to the LAD and OM1 and\ndeveloped pulmonary hemorrhage requiring intubation for airway\nprotection and respiratory compromise. His course was further\ncomplicated by respiratory failure with inability to wean off\nthe ventilator, acute renal failure, and decompensated liver\ndisease.  He ultimately succumbed to  multiorgan system\ndysfunction, and on the night of  the family decided to\nwithdraw aggressive care and provide comfort care. The patient\npassed shortly after extubation.\nCCU  MICU  .\n# Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): Overnight on\n he started having  pain in his bilateral posterior\nshoulder blades, radiating to the jaw. He got up to go to the\nbathroom and it worsened, and he had the onset of pain in the\nright chest as well.  No assoc N/V/diaphoresis/SOB.  EKG was\ndone, and showed new elevation in AVR with new depressions in I,\nII, V2-V6, concerning for left main disease/3VD.  His troponins\nincreased to peak of 0.33.  He was given nitroglycerin tabs x3\nwith resolution of his pain and improvement of ST-T segment\nchanges on EKG. Cardiology was consulted and the decision was\nmade to medically manage as long as he was chest pain free with\nplan for cardiac catheterization in AM. He was started on\naspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin and heparin drip.  Because\nhe was still symptomatic it was decided to take him to the cath\nlab.  Hepatology was involved in the decision to start statin\nand they agreed that the cardiovascular benefit was greater than\nadditional potential liver toxicity.\n    He was taken to the cath lab on  with radial approach\nwhich showed diffuse Disease to the LAD w/ 20% proximal and 80%\nhazy mid vessel and two BMS were deployed to the LAD and one BMS\nwas deployed to the OM1 after the patient continued to have chest pain while in the cath lab. He initially had slow flow in\nthe diag branches post intervention so bivalirudin was started.\nBivalirudin drip was used for anticoagulation in the cath lab in\naddition to ASA 325mg and a supratherapeutic heparin drip given\nearlier in the day.  Lasix bolus was given for perceived\npulmonary edema.  Shortly thereafter, he developed a coughing\nspell with frank hemoptysis and was transferred to the CCU for\nfurther monitoring (see below).  He was loaded with plavix 300\nmg the following day when his bleeding was improved and remained\nthereafter on 75mg daily. A few days later he developed new ST\ndepressions in V4-V6 with echocardiogram evidence of hypokinetic\napex. He was continued on ASA and plavix. However, in the\nsetting of hypotension and fevers, metoprolol was discontinued\nas patient was hypotensive and ultimately required vasopressors.\n.\n# Hemoptysis and respiratory failure: He developed hemoptysis in\nthe setting of several hours of supratherapeutic heparin gtt,\nbivalirudin given for stents as above, and thrombocytopenia from\nliver disease.  He was transferred from the cath lab to the CCU\nfor close monitoring given his hemoptysis.  When he arrived, he\nwas in respiratory failure and was intubated emergently on\n.  Pulmonary was consulted and they performed a\nbronchoscopy on  with visualization of fresh blood in the\nright lung.  They were unable to see a source for the bleeding\nbut injected epinephrine into the bronchus.  After this, his\nhematocrit stablized at 29 (baseline 35 on admission) and his\nchest xrays showed improvement.  Later, he continued to bleed on\n and multiple  PRBC and platelet transfusions.  He\ncontinued bleeding and therefore had a double lumen ETT placed.\nBleeding gradually decreased and HCT remained stable, however\ndeveloped progressive difficulty ventilating patient. CXR was\nsignificant for persistent extensive bilateral infiltrates\nconcerning for superimposed pneumonia, especially in setting of\nfevers and hypotension.\n.\n#  Nash cirrhosis: Patient's with abdominal distention, rapid\nweight fluctuations despite dietary stability likely reflect\nascites accumulation, and a positive shifting dullness.  Denied\nabdominal pain.  Per previous notes, in the weeks preceeding his\nadmission, he was aggressively diuresed with lasix 40,\nspironolactone 200mg to a dry weight of 223, but then developed\nrenal insufficiency (Cr 1.7 from 1.0), and hyponatremia to 132.\nAs aggressive diuresis led to renal failure, had therapeutic and\ndiagnostic paracentesis on  with removal of 1.9 L.  Ruled\nout spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with ascitic fluid\nstudies.  Infection was not a cause of kidney injury and ascites\nreaccumulation. The patient's liver function continued to\ndecompensate with increasing bilirubin and INR, reaccumulation\nof ascites, hypotension, and likely encephalopathy with later\ndevelopment of anuric renal failure unresponsive to trial of\nalbumin.\n.\n# Fevers\nPatient developed fevers during his MICU course. Given h/o\npulmonary hemorrhage and extensive persistent bilateral\ninfiltrates on CXR, there was concern for VAP. He was continued\non Vancomycin (for improving cellulitis) and cefepime was\nstarted, with later addition of levofloxacin. No definitive\ninfectious etiology found, with negative blood, urine, sputum\nand peritoneal fluid cultures.\n.\n# Hypotension\nPatient's BP gradually downtrending since . Initially related\nto sedatives and liver disease, but increasing concern for\nsepsis given development of fevers. Initially volume responsive,\nhowever, ultimately required up to three pressors\n(norepinephrine, neosynephrine, and vasopressin).\n.\n# Acute renal failure\nPatient with progressively worsening creatinine from 1.3 on to 4.5 on , with significantly reduced urine output starting\non . No structural abnormalities identified on ultrasound.\nGiven liver disease, concern for hepatorenal syndrome, however,\npatient failed to improve with fluid challenge and albumin.\nOther contributing insults included nephrotoxic medications,\ncontrast dye, and hypotension. A renal consult was obtained,\nhowever, found to indication for dialysis at the time of\nassessment. It was also unclear whether the patient would be a\ncandidate for CVVH as he was requiring multiple vasopressors for\nhemodynamic support.\n.\n# Cellulitis: Periumbilical erythema and warmth with demarcation\nsuggestive of cellulitis. Patient was treated with Vancomycin\nwith improvement in appearance.\n.\n# Abdominal hernia:  Small hernia appreciated on exam,\nnontender.  No concern for incarceration.\n.\n# Diabetes Mellitus II:   Held oral meds in favor of insulin\nsliding scale.\n.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "61yo female with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent\nhospitalization for complicated pna, pancreatitis, c-diff\ncolitis and adrenal insufficiency who presents with GI bleed,\nhypotension and hypoxia.\n\n#1: Anemia, GI bleed.\nPatient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a\nGI bleed. The patient required multiple transfusions of packed\nred  cells. Her hematocrit stabilized. There is no source\nof bleeding visualized on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis upon\nadmission. Laboratory evaluation was not significant for\nhemolysis. GI consultation felt that she was mostly suffering\nfrom a GI bleed however did not feel that an EGD or colonoscopy\nwas indicated due too severe to clinical status. The patient had\na second episode of melena with a drop in her hematocrit 2 days\nprior to death. Patient was transfused with 3 more units of\npacked red  cells, 2 platelet transfusions, one fresh\nfrozen plasma.\n\n#2: Sepsis\npatient presented with leukocytosis as well as elevated lactate\nand hypotension. Patient does have a history of known C.\ndifficile infection. Her  cultures that were initially\ndrawn in the emergency were positive. Patient was treated with\nlinezolid, IV vancomycin, meropenem. Eventually the IV\nvancomycin was discontinued as well as her meropenem. This\ncourse was complicated by continued elevations of her lactate as\nwell as white  cell count after initial improvement. Repeat\n culture showed gram-negative rods. The patient was\nrestarted on meropenem. The patient's pressure support\nrequirements increased prior to that. As for source of her\nsepsis it was not initially clear. Patient has possibly an\nintra-abdominal infection although there was no source of\ninfection found on CT of the abdomen. Patient was treated for\nquestionable ventilator associated pneumonia.\n\n#3: Altered mental status\nthe patient's mental status was altered throughout her stay.\nAlthough the patient was on sedatives for her intubation status\nwe eventually were able to discontinue sodas it without return\nof patient's normal baseline mental status. She does have\nunderlying dementia however per her family her mental status is\nworse. And neurologic consultation was obtained and they were\nunable to give a clear etiology as she has multiple medical\nproblems currently.  EEG was performed showing diffuse lower\nlegs but no specific evidence of nonconvulsive status\nepilepticus.\n\n#4: Direct hyperbilirubinemia.\nThroughout her stay her bilirubin as well as LFTs alkaline\nphosphatase became elevated. Was suggestive of obstructive or\ncholestatic process. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was\nobtained and did not show any intrahepatic obstruction but the\nCBD was not visualized. Possibly secondary to the mass effect of\nher pseudocyst. Surgery evaluated the patient and stated that a\nHIDA scan would most likely not be useful due to her severe\nclinical condition that would prevent any surgical intervention.\nHe discontinued all about toxic medications to help improve her\nliver function.\n\n#5: coagulopathy\nThe patient will coagulopathy as her liver function\ndeteriorated. Her INR was increased to above 2. After her second\nepisode of GI bleed the patient was given fresh frozen plasma to\nimprove her coagulation status. Her INR did improve to 1.7.\n\n#6: C. difficile colitis.\nPatient has a known history of C. difficile colitis. She had a\nnegative toxin by PCR was positive. The patient was treated with\np.o. vancomycin as well as IV Flagyl. A KUB was obtained and did\nnot show evidence of toxic megacolon.\n\n#7: Pancreatic pseudocyst\non initial CT of the abdomen the patient was found to have a\nlarge pancreatic pseudocyst with questionable hemorrhage versus\ninfection. Surgical consultation was obtained and they believe\nthat the pseudocyst had hemorrhage. They did not perform any\nintervention secondary to her severe clinical status.\n\n#8 hypoxic respiratory failure\nthe patient required intubation due to 2 persistent hypoxia.\nThere were multiple times to wean the patient from ventilation\nhowever it was not successful. The patient's ventilation status\nwas monitored with consistent arterial  gases. Respiratory\nfailure is most likely secondary to pulmonary edema. There was\nsome evidence later in her hospital course a ventilator\nassociated pneumonia and she was treated for such.\n\n#9 hypothyroidism\npatient has a known history of hypothyroidism. A TSH was drawn\nand was elevated. A free T4 was pending at the time of the\ndeath. During her admission we continue her home dose of\nlevothyroxine. There is little evidence that this was a myxedema\ncoma.\n\n#10 adrenal insufficiency\nPatient has a known history of adrenal insufficiency. She\nreceived stress dose of steroids on her initial admission. We\ncontinued her home dosing of prednisone.\n\n#11 gout\nKnown history of gout. We discontinued her allopurinol and\ncolchicine in the setting of acute kidney injury.\n\n#12 acute kidney injury\nPatient was admitted with acute kidney injury. Her renal\nfunction improved after fluid resuscitation.\n\n#13 COPD\nPatient is on home oxygen 2 to significant COPD. She was\nintubated.\n\n#14 coronary artery disease\nPatient has no history of coronary artery disease. We\ndiscontinued her  secondary to GI bleed. A Holter beta\nblocker and ACE inhibitor in the setting of hypotension. We\ncontinued her aspirin regimen.\n\nAfter continued deterioration in the setting of the ICU a family\nmeeting was held for goals care discussion. After lengthy\ndiscussion the family decided to make the patient comfort\nmeasures only. We discontinued pressor and ventilation support.\nThe patient expired approximately 3-4 hours after the patient\nwas made comfort measures only. Time of death was 01:00 on\n. Her primary care physician was notified. The\nfamily did not request autopsy.",

Urinalysis showed evidence of\ninfection and he was treated with ciprofloxacin, but urine\ncultures were negative and this was discontinued. Blood cultures\nshowed no growth. Cardiac enzymes remained flat at 0.06 after\nreportedly being 0.11 at osh. Was kept on telemetry with no\nconcerning rhythms. Exelon was dicontinued. Urine and serum tox\nwere neg. Finger sticks were WNL. TSH and B12 were measured with\na low B12 and B12 supplementation was initiated. Patient\nimproved with fluid resuscitation of 3 liters and was alert, but\nnot oriented. Neurological deficits were noted by primary team\nwith left upper extremity weakness, flattening of the left\nnasolabial fold and left ptosis and neurology was consulted. A\nhead CT showed no ischemic changes. Carotid dopplers were\nnegative and an Echo showed overall worsening of systolic\ndysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15-20%, but no mural\nthrombi. No further intervention was indicated.\n.\n# Dementia: Chronic, but has been progressive over the past\nmonth. Held exelon as was only new med and may have contributed\nto his acute MS change. There is no evidence that exelon will\nhave any additional benefit for his advanced dementia and is\nrelatively contraindicated in the elderly. Rapidly progressing\nnature of patient's dementia was discussed extensively with his\nson and it was explained that after extensive work-up, no\npotentially reversible causes have been identified and we\nrecommend no further intervention can be recommended.  Patient's\nstatus was discussed with son and the decision was made to\nprovide only comfort measures and Palliative care team was\nconsulted.  Patient became agitated and responded minimally to\nhaldol and olanzapine.  Patient was started on po morphine for\npain and agitation relief.  Pt died on respiratory distress on\n.\n.\n# Hypotension - Patient had hypotension with syetolic blood\npressures in the 70's that was initially unresposive to fluids\nwhich prompted an ICU admission. Anti-hypertensives were held\nand blood pressures eventually improved to 100's systolic with\nmore aggressive fluid resuscitation of 3 Liters. With\nprogressive decrease in po intake and the decision to hold IVF\nblood pressure ultimately dropped and patient became\nunresponsive.\n.\n# h/o CHF: EF = 25-30% on previous ECHO. Repeat ECHO showed\nworsening of systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of\n15-20%. Continued home ASA and statin. Held b-blocker, ACEi, and\ndiuretics because of hypotension.  Fluids to maintain urine\noutput and blood pressure resulted in dyspnea.  Decision was\nmade to provide comfort measures only and IVF were no longer\nadministered.",

He had received some antipsychotics and they\nseemed to exacerbate his confusion. On  he was taken off all\nantipsychotics and his aphasia improved. He was able to answer\nsimples questions and follows some commands but has poor\nattnetion. The patient was transferred to the neuro stepdown\nunit that day.\n\nOn  that patient seemed to be waxing and . At times he\nwas very alert and could follow commands and at other times he\nwas quite lethargic. He was evaluated by speech and swallow and\nwas unsafe to take in food by mouth. He was continued on tube\nfeeds.\n\nPsych evaluated the patient and felt that the patient did have\ndelirium. They recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and giving\nlow-dose haldol.\n\nOn  the patient's dilantin was found to be 20.9 so his\ndilantin was held until his level returned to a lower level. The\npatient was also given lasix for CHF. His exam was improving and\nhe was following commands again that day.\n\nOn  the dilantin was held again for elevated level. His INR\nwas noted to be elevated at 1.7 but this was allowed to trend\ndown on its own and no medication was given for reversal.\nOvernight the patient was less alert, was noted to have\ntachypnea and hypoxia with oxygen saturation in the 80s. His ABG\nshowed metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. He was\nstarted on vanco and zosyn for empiric coverage of hospital\nacquired pneumonia. His repeat ABG was stable.\n\nOn  the medicine team was consulted and the patient was\ntransferred their service.  The patient was started on cefepime\nfor his hospital acquired pneumonia and as he worsened\nvancomycin was again added.  His respiratory status continued to\ndecline.  His tube feeds were stopped in case of worsening\naspiration.  He had no evident cough reflex and likely had\ncontinuous aspiration and inability to protect his airway.

Concern for cellulitis vs. necrotising\nfascitis.  The patient had a prior history of pseudomonal\ncellulitis on her left leg.  On hospital day 6 she was developed\nfevers to 101.8, rigors and became hypotensive to 70/40 which\ndid not respond to fluid boluses.  Her left leg was noted to\nlook markedly cellulitis with erythema and tendernss.  She was\nplaced on cefepime, flagyl and tobramycin given previous\npseudomonal sensitivities. She was transferred to the intensive\ncare unit where she was placed on pressors.  The patient was\nseen by sugery and the ID consult service.  There was concern\nthat her leg infection might represent necrotising fasciitis.\nCT scan of the left leg revealed extensive muscle edema but no\nclear evidence of necrotising fasciitis but it was unclear what\ntype of inflammatory response the patient would mount given her\nneutropenia.  The patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened to\ninclude meropenem, daptomycin and clindamycin and ultimately\nswitched to vancomycin and meropenem.  The decision was made to\nnot take the patient to the operating room because the picture\nwas not entirely clear and it was felt that the patient would\nnot tolerate an extensive surgical procedure.  Her cellulitis\nslowly improved with broad spectrum antibiotics.  She completed\na 21 day course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Ultimately she\ndeveloped a well healing black eschar on the area, but never\nfully resolved.\n.\nSepsis: On hospital day 6 the patient developed rigors, fevers\nto 101.8 and became hypotensive to the 70s systolic which was\nnot responsive to fluid boluses.  At that time her leg was\nmarkedly cellulitis with erythema, warmth and tenderness.  Blood\nand urine cultures were negative.  CXR at that time showed no\nevidence of infiltrate.  It was felt that her sepsis was most\nlikely secondary to her leg wound.  She was placed on broad\nspectrum antibiotics per the infectious disease service as\ndescribed below.  She required pressors for blood pressure\nsupport.  She received aggressive volume resucitation with IVF,\nblood and albumin.  She was weaned off pressors after the\ninitial 24 hour period but became hypotensive for a second time\nand was placed back on pressors for an additional 72 hours.\nFollowing this she was hemodynamically stable for the remainder\nof her MICU course. She completed a 21 day course of meropenem\nand vancomycin for her leg wound with slow clinical improvement.\n Despite further aggressive care, she later developed both\naspergillosis in lungs and CMV viremia.  Both were treated\naggressively and Infectious disease followed her throughout most\nof her hospitalization.  Ultimately, however, despite multiple\nantibiotics, antifungals and antivirals, she did not overcome\nher numerous infections and succumbed to massive sepsis.\n.\nRenal Failure: During her MICU course the patient developed\nacute renal failure with her creatinine increasing from a\nbaseline of 0.4 to a peak of 1.3.  Urine electrolytes were not\nconsistent with a prerenal etiology and her urine output was not\nresponsive to fluid boluses.  Her urine sediment had many\ngranular casts.  It was felt that her renal failure was most\nlikely secondary to ATN induced by her long period of\nhypotension and pressor requirement.  The patient was oliguric\nfor approximately one week and subsequently became severely\nvolume overloaded ultimately leading to intubation for\nrespiratory distress.  The renal service was consulted who\nrecommended aggressive diuresis.  Despite being on a lasix drip,\nher renal function continued to decline.  A discussion was held\nwith her family and the Renal team concerning further course of\ntherapy given that many of her medications were nephrotoxic and\nshe may need dialysis.  Both her family and the Renal team\nagreed with this course of action.  In the last 24 hours of her\nlife, however, she had a rapid decline related to her\noverwhelming sepsis and not renal function and never required HD\nprior to death.\n.\nInvasive Fungal Infection: The patient was noted to have\naspergillus growing in her sputum on two samples.  The\nspeciation of the mold suggested a non-pathogenic species but\nthe patient's fungal markers were significantly elevated.  CT of\nthe chest did not reveal a clear fungal pneumonia.  She\nunderwent MRI of the brain which showed an air fluid level in\nthe sphenoid sinuses.  ENT biopsied a small ulcer in her middle\nturbinate which ultimately came back positive for aspergillus\ninfection.  She underwent debridement of her nasal septum and\nturbinate on  and pathology results showed evidence of\nangioinvasive fungal infection.  She was treated initially with\nposiconazole and ambisome with close monitoring of her liver and\nkidney function.  Her beta-glucan and galactomanan levels were\nconsistently monitored for signs of decreasing infection.\nDespite aggressive therapy, the infection was ultimately\noverwhelming.\n.\nRespiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on  for\nrespiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema.  Chest CT\nshowed bilateral pleural effusions but no clear evidence of\ninfection.  Sputum cultures revealed aspergillus in two samples\n(non fumagatus//flavus species).  BAL with minimal mucous,\ncultures negative. Despite aggressive diuresis she continued to\nhave poor NIFs and RSBIs.  She ultimately underwent trachestomy\non  for prolonged respiratory failure.  She continued on\ntrach AC until her death, never tolerating breathing on her own.\n.\nGVHD of the GI tract:  The patient was originally admitted with\ndiarrhea felt to be secondary to GVHD.  She underwent\ncolonoscopy which showed granularity consistent with GVHD.\nBiopsy, however, was not definiative.  She did have evidence of\nCMV reactivation but CMV cultures from the colon were negative.\nStool cultures and clostridium difficile toxins were negative as\nwell.  The patient was initially treated with increasing doses\nof immunosuppresive agents including Solumedrol, cyclosporin and\ncellcept.  She also received one dose of IVIG when her IgG\nlevels were found to be low.  She was started on TPN.  When she\npresented with sepsis her cellcept was discontinued and the\ndoses of her other immunosuppresives were reduced.   For much of\nher MICU course she had no evidence of stool production and\nhypoactive bowel sounds.   She also had persistently elevated\nliver enzymes indicative of ongoing GVHD.  Her steroids were\nintermittently increased and then decreased given the fine\nbalance between managing her GVHD and controlling her multiple\ninfections.\n.\nThrombocytopenia:  Throughout her MICU course the patient has\nhad significant thrombocytopenia requiring platelet\ntransfusions.  The etiology of this is unclear but has been felt\nto be secondary to marrowsuppressive effects of her medications\nincluding gancyclovir and cyclosporin.  She was HIT negative.\nDIC labs negative on multiple occassions. She did receive IVIG\non  with little improvement in her platelet count.  She was\ntransfused as needed for platelet counts less than 30 or when\nshe developed oozing from her trach or sinuses after\ndebridement.\n.\nAnemia: The patient was also noted to have anemia throughout her\nMICU course.  She was found to have a decreased reticulocyte\ncount and an elevated ferritin consistent with an inflammatory\nanemia.  She received multiple red blood cell transfusions.\n.\nEmbolic vs. Watershed infarcts:  Patient noted to have three\nsmall acute to subacute infarcts involving the right superiour\nfontal lobe and right inferior cerebellum.  Unclear etiology.\nConcern that these represent fungal infection.  She underwent\nTTE which was inconclusive for fungal endocarditis.  She had a\nrepeat MRI on  which was limited secondary to motion, but\nultimately read by Neuroradiology as no progression.  No further\nimaging was obtained, and she was never alert enough to perform\na meaningful neurological exam.\n.\nSinus Bradycardia: Postoperatively the patient was noted to have\nsinus bradycardia of unclear etiology but felt to be secondary\nto post-operative sedation causing increased vagal tone.  EKG\nwith no other significant changes.  This resolved for almost 10\ndays until the last 24 hours of her life, when she progressively\nhad bradycardia until asystole.\n.\nAtrial Fibrillation: Patient with intermittent atrial\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular response during this\nhospitalization.  Hemodynamically stable during this episodes.\nShe has been treated with digoxin on a number of occassions as\nneeded for rate control with good effect.   She was not\nanticoagulated given her thrombocytopenia and elevated IRN.\n.\nElevated INR/Elevated total bilirubin:  Throughout her MICU\ncourse the patient has had fluctuating liver function tests, INR\nand total bilrubin.  Originally she was felt to have liver\nfunction test abnormalities secondary to hypotension her\ntransaminases were never dramatically elevated.  Her\ntransasminases have since normalized with a persistently\nelevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.  Multiple RUQ\nultrasounds have been negative for cholecystitis and portal\nvenous thrombosis.  There was also concern that her LFT\nabnormalities might be secondary to medications\n(caspufugin/voriconazole/ambisome) or GVHD of the liver.  Her\nfungal coverage was switched from voriconazole to posaconazole\nfor decreased hepatic toxicity.  Her IV steroids were decreased\nto see if this would unmask GVHD of the liver.  Her LFTs and\nTbili continued to rise, concerning for worsening GVHD, so her\nsteroids were increased.  Towards the end of her life, her Tbili\nindicated worsening damage and concern for uncontrolled GVHD\ndespite immunosuppresion.  Heme-Onc followed her throughout her\nstay, and their input was greatly appreciated.\n.\nCMV: Patient has had evidence of CMV infection throughout her\nMICU course.  Viral load trended up from 2960 to 49,000 and\nfinally started trending down when started on higher induction\ndoses of gancyclovir dosed for her creatinine clearance.\nUltimately, it began rising again and became uncontrolled.  ID,\nwho was following her throughout her stay, had multiple\ndiscussions with the family about the use of foscarnet given\nthat this may lead to complete renal failure.  Her family was in\nline with this decision making and she was started on it only\nvery briefly before she rapidly declined over the course of a\nday and died from asystole.\n.\nMDS:  The patient was status post-bone marrow transplant.  Her\npost-transplant course has been complicated by GVHD of the GI\ntract and CMV infection.  She currently is on reduced doses of\ncyclosporin and solumedrol for GVHD treatment.  Her last\nchimerism showed 100% engraftment.  Followed by Heme-Onc\nthroughout her inpatient stay.\n.\nDVT: CT of lower extremities from  shows bilateral DVTs.\nPatient is thrombocytopenic so will not continue her on lovenox.\n She has an IVC filter in place.  No pneumoboots were used given\nknown DVT.  Additionally, anticoagulation was held due to her\nthrombocytopenia, anemia and oozing from multiple wound sites.\n.\nHypothyroidism.  Continue levothyroxine throughout her stay.\n.\nHyperglycemia.  Improved.  Continue sliding scale with insulin\nin TPN.  Continue to follow nutrition recs. Goal per Heme/Onc is\nfor patient to be borderline hypoglycemic. She did well with\nthis during her stay.\n.\nUltimately, given these multiple medical problems and\noverwhelming infection, Mrs.  had a quick decompensation the\nlast 24 hours of her death signaled by progressive bradycardia.\nHer family was called to her bedside given their wishes that she\nbe DNR.  Early in the morning of  she developed asystole\nand was prounounced dead by Dr.  .",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "64 yo M with AML s/p double cord transplant presenting with 3\ndays of watery diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n\n course:\nAdmitted to ICU  with an acute episode of worsening\ntachypnea to the 40s, shortness of breath, wheezing, and\ntachycardia to the 180s in the setting of walking to and from\nthe commode.  An EKG showed a supraventricular tachycardia.  He\nwas given 2mg of morphine and 40mg of IV Lasix for concern of\nflash pulmonary edema and was transferred to the ICU satting\n100% on a NRB.  On arrival to the ICU, the patient was in acute\nrespiratory distress, agitated, anxious, tachycardic, and\ntachypneic.  He was asking for his oxygen to be turned up even\nfurther.  Given his distress, he was emergently intubated.\nRespiratory distress thought to be in settting of parainfluenza\ntype 3 PNA as he had been dyspneic and wheezing for days since\ndiagnosis.  Also thought to be in setting of flash pulmonary\nedema.\nCardiac enzymes were checked considering ST segment changes, and\nhe ruled in for NSTEMI.  Weaning from the vent proved difficult,\nas he would develop agitation and increased work of breathing\nduring subsequent spontaneous breathing trials that were\nconcerning for flash pulmonary edema.  Imaging showed a diffuse\nmultifocal pneumonia.  His antibiotics had already included\nvancomycin from a  blood culture of coag positive and\nnegative staph, though per BMT recs these antibiotics were\nre-expanded to vancomycin and cefepime on  for fevers and\nhypotension.  Meropenem was substituted for cefepime on ,\nand PO vanco was added for empiric c dif coverage at that time\nas well.  A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed at that time for\nsuspected pulmonary source of infection, demonstrating positive\nparainfluenza 3 though negative PCP, , bacterial cultures.\nMultiple serum assays including adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HSV, HHV6\nwere negative.  A galactomanan was positive x2 but was felt to\nrepresent a false positive due to recent IVIG treatment.  He\nunderwent CT torso on  due to worsening fever and\nleukocytosis, showing significantly worse diffuse bilateral\ngroundglass increased in extent and confluent from ,\nthickening bronchial walls, more dense consolidation in the\nright upper lobe, and left upper lobe concerning for diffuse\ninfection with bacterial superinfection on atypical process.\nAfter failure to improve on vanco//voriconazole/acyclovir,\nhe was started on ambisome for enhanced fungal coverage on ,\nand fungal isolator cultures were sent which were negative.\nVoriconazole was stopped, and vancomycin was discontinued in\nfavor of linezolid at that time for a blood culture growing VRE\nfrom .  His respiratory status failed to improve.\nConcerned for a post-viral BOOP, pulse dose steroids were\nstarted on  at Methylprednisolone 500 mg IV Q24H x 3d,\nthough his respiratory mechanics actually worsened somewhat with\ndecreasing compliance concerning for a post-ARDS fibrosis.  In\nlight of a need for tracheostomy for continued support and\nfailure to improve, a family meeting was thenheld on with the BMT and  teams regarding our inability to liberate\nhim from the ventilator.  His wife expressed the patients wishes\nnever to undergo prolonged supportive measures including\ntracheostomy, and elected to pursue terminal extubation with\nshift of care goals towards comfort measures.  Non-essential\nmedications were discontinued, and he was continued on a\nfentanyl gtt.  He was extubated with family at the bedside and\ndied within an hour at 18:45 on .\n\nOther ICU events that were notable included an NSTEMI on\n, which the cardiology consult team felt was consistent\nwith acute plaque rupture. He was treated medically with\naspirin, plavix, lovenox, statin, beta blocker.  Catheterization\nwas not pursued.  TTE showed no valvular disease or WMA though\nthe quality of the study was limited.\n\nPatient also developed a metabolic acidosis thought likely to be\n renal tubular acidosis on .  Renal team was consulted\nwho recommended sodium bicarb infusions, also recommended renal\nultrasound which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nHe initially presented with diarrhea felt to be due to GVHD. He\nwas kept on TPN.  Of note, and extensive diarrhea work up was\niniitiated, including stool elastase, chromogranin, 5-hiaa,\nyersina, ttg/iga, gastrin, seratonin, and vip.  He was found to\nhave an elevated chromogranin-A level 42, and was therefore sent\nfor an octreodtide scan to rule out carcinoid which was\nnegative.  His steroids were uptitrated and cyclosporine\ndiscontinued.  Steroids were tapered when his infectious picture\nworsened with parainfluenza, and were rapidly curtailed.  He\nlater underwent steroid pulse towards the end of his hospital\nstay without much mprovement in his pulmonary status.  Multiple\nCdif assays and a PCR were negative.\n\nPatient also had LUE swelling, US showed partially occlusive\nleft IJ thrombus. Line was removed and he was started on lovenox\nand later heparin gtt for one month, which was then\ndiscontinued.\n\nHe was also noted to have transaminits throughout admission\nwhich peaked then normalized, then peaked again.  It was likely\nsecondary to GVHD, especially in the setting of his diarrhea and\nskin changes.",

Blood\ntinged sputum could be  CHF especially given improvement with\ndiuresis on last admission.  However, cannot rule out PNA (see\nbelow).  Patient continued on ASA 81 and metoprolol.  Held off\non ACEi  progressive renal failure.  Patient initially\ndiuresed well with IV lasix 100mg .  However, patient had\nless diuresis with doses of lasix.\n\n# PNA- Patient presented with increasing shortness of breath and\nhemoptysis.  Although patient afebrile and without leukocytosis\n(he did have left shift), difficult to rule out HCAP.  Patient\ntreated with 5-day course of cefepime and vanc to cover HCAP.\nBCx, sputum culture showed sparse growth of commensual oral\nflora.\n\n# AS- Patient has severe AS.  Likely contributing to HF.  Was\nbeing considered for AVR, however currently a surgical\ncandidate.  Patient underwent balloon valvuloplasty which was\ncomplicated by TIA.  Patient had full recovery of neurologic\nfunction and was transferred to the CCU for observation.\n\n# Acute on chronic Renal Failure- Cr on admission 2.9, baseline\n2.2.  Patient clinically not dehydrated.  No h/o poor fluid\nintake or diarrhea, vomiting.  Could be from CHF and poor\nforward flow.  FEurea 22%, consistent with pre-renal etiology.\nPregabalin dosed per CrCl.\n\n# Altered mental status- Patient delirious, with waxing and\n level of alertness and orientation.  DDx includes uremia\ngiven worsening renal failure.  Less likely hypercapneia poor gas exchange from pleural effusion, retention from COPD.\nMedication could also be a contributing factor though patient\nnot on anticholinergics and no recent new meds.\n\n# CAD- Has history of CAD with stents to LAD and LCx.  Last cath\non  showed patent stents.  Patient w/o CP or EKG changes.\nTroponin elevated to 2.30 on admission (baseline 0.1-0.5), CKMB\nnot elevated.  Likely  progressive renal failure and CHF.\nContinued ASA and metoprolol.\n\n# HTN- BP controlled since arrival to hospital. Continued home\ndose metoprolol.\n\n# Postherpetic neuralgia- Prior history of herpes zoster\ninfection. No active lesions at present time. Pt still complains\nof significant postherpetic neuralgia.  Continued lyrica 25mg\nAM, 50mg PM, and Lidoderm patches.\n\n# DM Type II- Covered with insulin sliding scale.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "68F amyotrophic lateral sclerosis now with large saddle\npulmonary embolus and extensive bilateral lower extremity deep\nvenous thromboses status post t-PA.\n\n1. Hemodynamic instability: Patient was initially hypotensive\nupon presentation to the emergency department.  However, patient\nresponded to large volume IV fluid boluses, and pressure\ncontinued to improve following administration of tPA.  Patient\ncontinued to require occasional boluses of fluid following\ntransfer to the unit, but was completely hemodynamically stable\nby hospital day 5 at which point she was transferred to the\nfloor.\n\n2. Pulmonary Embolus and Deep vein thromboses: Given patient's\nlarge clot burden, hemodynamic instability, and initial hypoxia,\npatient was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen\nactivator.  Doppler ultrasound of upper and lower extremities\nrevealed extensive deep vein thromboses in the lower extremities\nbilaterally, with none in the upper extremities.  Therefore, a\npermanent  IVC filter was placed by interventional\nradiology, and patient was anticoagulated with heparin (target\nPTT range 60-100).\n\nOf note, following administration of tPA, patient's hematocrit\ndropped ten points, and patient underwent CT of abdomen and\npelvis, which was unrevealing for any occult bleed.  Therefore,\nthe hematocrit change was thought to be due to hemodilution,\ngiven administration of large volumes of IV fluids upon\npresentation to ED.\n\nGiven patient's high risk for further episodes of DVT and PE due\nto chronic immobilization secondary to ALS, patient was started\non warfarin with a target INR of 2.0-3.0 for chronic\nanticoagulation.  At the time of discharge, patient's INR had\nbeen within therapeutic range for 36 hours with overlap of\nheparin infusion for continued anticoagulation.\n\nLikely due to statsis via ALS. S/P t-PA. Continue Heparin GTT\nand Coumadin for INR goal . ECHO with no significant\nabnormalities, but cycling CEs. CE's remained flat.  LE US\nshowed massive clot burden, and IVC filter was placed on .\nUE US was negative for DVT.  Will continue hep gtt with goal PTT\n60-80.\n\n2.  Urinary tract infection and pneumonia:  On hospital day 3,\npatient was found to be febrile without obvious clinical\nsymptoms.  Urinalysis identified a urinary tract infection.\nChest X-ray performed at the time also revealed a posterior\ninfiltrate.  Sputum gram stain identified 4+ gram negative rods,\nbut eventually cultured Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to\nlevofloxacin.  Therefore, patient was initiated on antibiotic\ntherapy for treatment of both entities.  Patient defervesced and\nwas treated with a total of seven days on antibiotics.\n\n3. ALS: Continued outpatient treatment per primary neurologist,\nRilutek 50 mg PO BID, throughout hospitalization.  Patient's\nmobility was apparently at baseline, and physical therapists\nfelt that patient did not require any acute rehabilitation.\nPatient also experienced some agitation (secondary to\ninfection), and Ativan was given with good effect.\n\nDuring hospitalization, goals of care were discussed with\npatient, family, primary care physician ( , MD), and\nteam.  It was made very clear that patient was not to be\ninformed of terminal prognosis of ALS, and patient wanted full\ncode to be performed for apneia/cardiac arrest.  It was agreed\nupon, however, that this issue would be readdressed should\npatient require any further aggressive measures.\n\nAt the time of discharge, patient's INR had been within\ntherapeutic range for greater 24 hours, patient had been\nhemodynamically stable, and had no further signs or symptoms of\ndeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "#Pelvic Mass:  On  the patient was admitted to  to be evaluated by surgical and gynecological services.\nAbdominal CT scan showed - 15.9 x 14.2 x 15.9 cm mass ,\nincompletely encasing sigmoid colon. Small amount of oral\ncontrast seen passing through sigmoid colon. Mild dilation of\ncolon proximal to mass. Given the involvement of the sigmoid\ncolon, the patient was admitted to the General Surgery team for\npossible surgical resection.  On , a CT guided biopsy was\nperformed which showed features suggestive of an unusual ovarian\nadenocarcinoma.  The staining pattern suggests clear cell\ncarcinoma of the ovary, or possibly metastatic endometrial\ncarcinoma.  Adrenal, renal or colonic origin are unlikely.\nMesothelioma is unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded based\non the available information.\nGiven the pathology findings, the patient was transferred to the\nGYN ONC service for further management.\n\nThe patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, pelvic mass\nresection and cystectomy with ileoconduit placement by Drs  and   on . Please see operative note for\ndetails. The patient was admitted to the ICU postoperatively\ngiven 2 minutes of hypotension during surgery.\n\n#Nutrition/GI:\nPreoperatively, a PICC line was placed for TPN given minimal PO\nintake. Postoperatively, the patient's TPN was restarted.\nTPN was restarted following surgery. Nutrition consult\nfollowing. The patient passed flatus and bowel movement\npostoperatively; her diet was advanced to regular. TPN continued\nuntil time of discharge due to limited PO intake. The patient\nrefused TPN at time of discharge.\n\nThe patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy which revealed normal 15cm\nbut unable to advance scope due to insufficient bowel cleansing.\n\n\n#ID:\nThe patient was started on Flagyl/Keflex postoperatively for\nempiric treatment given extent of surgery.\n\n-Pseudomonas infection: Postoperatively, her WBC was noted to\ndouble from 12 to 25. Peak WBC 39 while in the ICU.  Blood\ncultures, JP fluid cultures, urine culture from ileo-conduit and\nwound culture were obtained. Pan-sensitive pseudomonas returned\nin urine, wound and JP drainage. An ID consult recommended IV\nand PO vancomycin and Zosyn.  A CT scan was performed which\ndemonstrated a post operative fluid collection vs hemotoma vs.\norganizing infection. An interventional radiology consult stated\nthat the fluid was not-amenable to drainage. As the patient's\nWBC improved with IV antibiotic treatment and the patient\nremained afebrile, further surgical management was not pursued.\nHer antibiotics were narrowed to Zosyn IV. The patient was to\nreceive PICC line IV treatments for total 14 days following\ndischarge. Her WBC was normal at time of discharge. A repeat\nurine culture pending at time of discharge; but no bacteria\npresent on urinalysis.\n\n#Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative 2. The\npatient remained on room air. A CT scan on  was performed to\nevaluate for pulmonary metastasis; this workup was negative.\nThe patient experienced acute dyspnea on postoperative day 9\nduring a blood transfusion. She received 2 doses of albuterol\nnebulizers; she desaturated to 89% room air.  She needed minimal\noxygen support upon her readmission to the ICU.  She was\ndischarged on room air.\n\n#Heme:\nThe patient's HCT was followed closely. The patient received 9\nunits of blood during surgery and her initial postoperative stay\nto keep her HCT above 25. On postoperative day 9, the patient's\nhematocrit was noted to be slowly dropping from 28 -> 26 -> 23.\nIt was unclear the cause of the hematocrit drop: slow bleeding\nfrom operative site vs hematoma.  The patient was transfused unit of blood before hemolytic reaction occurred (see below).\nThis blood transfusion was discontinued immediately. During her\n2nd ICU stay, the patient received 2 additional pRBC units that\nwere screened by the Blood Bank after consultation with the\ntransfusion fellow.  Her postoperative HCT remained stable daily\nafter the hemolytic reaction (bewlow) at 29-30.\n\n-Hemolytic Reaction:  The patient experienced an acute hemolytic\nreaction manifested by acute onset of dyspnea on postoperative\nday 9. This unit of blood was discontinued immediately. She\nreceived 2 doses of Albuterol nebulizer treatment. She received\n25 mg Benadryl, 40 mg Lasix IV and 20 mg proton pump inhibitor.\nDue to the patient's acute pulmonary distress and elevated\nrespiratory rate to 40, a code Blue was called to facilitate any\nneed for possible intubation.  No intubation or cardiac\nresuscitation was needed.  A transfusion fellow consult was\ncalled stat. A repeat type and screen found a JKA antibody in\nthe patient's blood. The patient was transferred to the ICU for\nfurther monitoring.\n\n#Cardiac: The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation\nprior to surgery. The patient was rate controlled prior to\nsurgery with Metoprolol and Diltiazem in the 80s-90s. She was\nfollowed on telemetry. A medicine consult was called\npreoperatively for assessment of her cardiac function. Prior\ncardiac evaluation was obtained from her PCP documenting an\nejection fracture of 55% on recent Echo and 65% on recent stress\ntest.\nFollowing surgery, postoperative cardiac enzymes were negative x\n3.\n\n-Hypotension: Occurred intraoperatively for which the patient\nwas placed on 2 pressors which were weaned off in the ICU. The\npatient maintained a MAP of 65 per A-line. All pressors were\ndiscontinued by time of ICU discharge and Metoprolol was\nrestarted.\n\n-Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was maintained on telemetry\nand rate controlled with Metoprolol in the 80s-90s.  She was\nrestarted on her Coumadin when tolerating adequate PO on\npostoperative day 11.\n.\n# Pain: Patient had high level of post-operative pain treated\nwith morphine PCA which was transitioned to PO due to patient\nsomnolence. Patient able to wean off pain medications and as of\n required minimal PO medications.\n.\n# Coagulopathy: INR elevated following surgery to 1.6 attributed\nto multiple transfusions intraoperatively. The patient responded\nwell to one unit of FFP with INR 1.2. INR trended to 1.0\nspontaneously prior to discharge.  INR followed daily following\nrestart of Coumadin. INR 1.1 at time of discharge. VNA to follow\nINR daily upon discharge.\n.\n# Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine continued\n.\n# Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, aspiration precautions,\npneumoboots when patient accepted.\n.\n# Code: Full, confirmed w/ HCP\n\n#Dispo: Patient discharged on  with VNA services, ostomy\ncare, and follow up with Urology, INR checks to be followed by\nPCP,  and Thoracic oncology.",

For further\nsurgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.\nFollowing the operation, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive\nmonitoring. His early postoperative course was complicated by\nfevers, agitation, diabetes insipidus, hepatitis and acute renal\ninsufficiency. The renal service was consulted and attributed\nhis diabetes insipidus to Lithium. He was treated with free\nwater and Ddavp while Sodium levels were monitored closely.  The\nHepatology service was also consulted and attributed his\nhepatitis to peri-operative shock liver. A renal/abdominal\nultrasound on postoperative day one was unremarkable. He was\nintermittently transfused to optimize hemodynamics, while all\nnephrotoxins and hepatotoxins were avoided. Given agitation and\nclinical status, he was kept sedated and intubated for several\ndays. He was pan-cultured for fevers with all cultures remaining\nnegative. His creatinine peaked to 2.9. His LFTs peaked with an\nALT of  and AST of 3202. Bilirubins remained within normal\nlimits. Amylase and lipase levels peaked later in his\npostoperative course - 181 and 430 respectively. The Psychiatric\nservice was also consulted and recommended to continue to hold\nLithium with reevaluation for another mood stablizer once\nmedical issues stablize. Lithium levels were monitored closely\nas well. Mr.  was eventually extubated on postoperative\nday four. By that time, he made significant clinical\nimprovements as did his renal and liver function. He was out of\nbed, alert and oriented without agitation, and tolerating a\ndiet. He continued to make progress and eventually transferred\nto the SDU on postoperative seven. He continued to progress and\nwork with physical therapy.  Psychiatry continued to follow him\nand on post operative day 10 he was started on lamictal and\nzyprexa.  He continued to increase activity and was ready for\ndischarge home with VNA on postoperaive day 12.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr.  was admitted to the  on  for further\nmanagement of his chest pain. He ruled in for a non-ST-Elevation\nmyocardial infarction and was started on plavix and heparin. He\nunderwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe 2\nvessel disease. Please see cathterization report for details.\nGiven the severity fo his disease, the cardiac surgical service\nwas consulted and Mr.  was worked-up in the usual\npreoperative manner. A carotid duplex ultrasound revealed less\nthen a 40% bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. aAn\nisolated elevated amylase level was found twice during\nadmission. He complained of no abdominal pain, diarrhea,\nconstipation, or jaundice recently. He did, however, report\nparotid gland manipulation many years ago. It was decided not to\nwork up this lab value with imaging due to this history. Plavix\nwas held and allowed to wash out prior to his surgery. He was\ndiuresed for volume overload. On , Mr.  was taken\nto the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass\ngrafting to four vessels. Please see operative note for details.\nPostopertaively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive\ncare uniit for monitoring. His AICD/Pacer was interrogated by\nthe electrophysiology service. He required vasopressors for\nhypotension and was given methylene blue for cardio vasoplegic\nsyndrome intraop and postoperatively. He was transfused for\npostoperative anemia. He later awoke neurologically intact and\nwas extubated. His pressors were slowly weaned off. Gentle\ndiuresis was initiated. On postoperative day three he was\ntransferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He had a\ndrop in platelets and HITT antibody sent was positive.\nHematology was consulted and it was recommended Coumadin and\nArgatroban be started until Serotonin Release Assay result was\nback.  This result was negative on post operative day 7 and\nargatroban and coumadin were stopped.  He did devlop rapid\natrial flutter on post operative day 7 and converted to sinus\nrhythm with amiodarone bolus and drip. He was being paced with\nhis internal pacer at this time and epicaridal wires were\ndiscontinued without incidence once INR decreased and platelet\ncount had increased to >200. The physical therapy service was\nconsulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and\nmobility. He remained fluid overloaded and continued to require\naggressive diuresis. Over several days, he continued to make\nslow clinical improvements, and was eventually cleared for\ndischarge to home on postoperative day ten. Given fluid status\nand LVEF 45%, he will continue to require diuresis at discharge.\nAt discharge, he will also be given a course of Keflex for\ncellulitis of his left lower extremity. He will followup with\n in one week for wound check.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Floor course prior to ICU transfer:\nPt was admitted to Dr. Urology service after undergoing\nL debulking nephrectomy.  Please see the dictated operative note\nfor details.  In the first two post-operative days, pain control\nwas especially difficult to obtain.  Although the epidural\ncatheter was working, its level was too high to cover the entire\nincision, and a significant narcotic load was necessary to\ncontrol the pt's pain.  The patient's urine output remained\nexcellent.  On , the chest tube was removed, and\npost-pull CXR showed a 20-30% PTX and new left lower lobe\ncollapse, likely from mucus plugging.  Interventional\npulmonology was consulted, who recommended bronchoscopy in the\nAM of .  However, early in the AM of , she had oxygen\ndesaturation down to 70% and was transferred to the , where\nshe was stabilized.\n\n course:\nOn  she had a radical left nephrectomy which involved entry\ninto the chest and placement of a Chest tube; transfused 2 units\nin the OR.  Chest tube was pulled on  wuth subsequent CXR\nrevealing 30% pneumothorax and new atelectasis of the left lower\nlobe. Plan was to follow pneumothorax with imaging until\nresolution and bronch on  for new LLL findings. Early on\n, she desaturated to the low 70s repeatedly when taking off\nher shovel mask. New tachycardia to the 130s prompted a repeat\nCXR which demonstrated new opacity over entire left lung field.\nShe was given lopressor 5mg IV and HR decreased to low 100s; O2\nsat improved to mid 90s on 2L nc with coughing. Transferred to\nFICUon  for further mgt and bronchoscopy. Vitals at initial\nevaluation: 99.9, 136/76, HR 135-->100s, 16, 97% fase mask.\n\nBronch done revealing extensive accumulation of mucus more so in\nleft lung than right. Mucus aspirated. Procedure complicated by\ndelirium likely from sedation. Repeat CXR demonstrated renewed\naeration of the lung.  Pt oxygen requirement improved over ,\nand plan to call out of the  on  was delayed by\ntachycardia and poor venous access.  Sinus Tachycardia into the\n130s improved s/p 2L NS. PICC was placed for venous\naccess--PA/LATERAL ordered to confirm Picc placemant as ther was\nsome concern that it might be coiled on portable film but was in\nplace on repeat film.\n.\nOn the floor, she was called out to Medical Oncology. Her pain\nwas controlled with Dilaudid PCA initially which was\nsubsequently changed to MS Contin  with PO dilaudid for\nbreakthrough. She was seen by orthoopedics to clarify\nweightbearing status since had hip metastases with cortical\ninvolvement on CT. Orthopedics recommended weight bearing as\ntolerated using walker and she cleared physical therapy for\ndischarge home with home PT. She was instructed to follow up\nwith Ortho (Dr.  ) and have serial CTs on time\ncourse per their recommendations to monitor metastatic disease.\nShe was weaned off oxygen and was satting mid 90s at rest on\nroom air and 88-91% with ambulation on discharge. She was given\nprescription for home oxygento use with exertion. She was\ncontinued on nebs including mucomyst, levalbuterol and\nipratropium and given flutter valve device.",

CT scan demonstrated marked\ndistention of what appeared to be the duodenal segment of the\npancreas. Based upon clinical presentation, he was\nbrought to the operating room by Dr.   on .\nHe underwent exploratory laparotomy, bowel resection, and\ntransplant pancreatectomy for torsion of the pancreas and\nperitonitis. Per Dr. note, the Roux limb had marked\ncongestion and distention extending down through the mesocolon\nof the sigmoid colon and into the pancreatic duodenal\nanastomosis. The duodenal segment of the pancreas also appeared\nto be very distended and necrotic. It appeared that there was a\nvolvulus of the mesentery of the Roux limb as it traversed the\nmesocolon leading to\ncongestion, obstruction, and ultimately necrosis of the duodenal\nsegment and likely the very end of the Roux limb. A JP drain and\nNG were placed. Please see operative report for further details.\nIn PACU iv lopressor and labetalol were given for elevated SBPs.\nUrine output was great. Aside from this, pacu stay was\nuneventful. Postop hct was 26.8 from preop hct of 28.8.\n\nPod 0, he had a temp of 102. Blood and urine cultures were sent.\nUrine was negative and blood was negative to date.\n\nInitially, he was started on an insulin drip to manage his\nglucoses. When diet was advanced, the drip was changed to\nGlargine and sliding scale humalog insulin with good control.\nOnce passing flatus, diet was slowly advanced and tolerated.\nPain medication was switched to po pain medication.\n\nCreatinine decreased to 1.1, but then trended up to 1.8 on POD 4. Lisinopril was held given that BP was well controlled. It\nwas felt that tacrolimus contributed to the elevated creatinine\ngiven that tacrolimus level increased to 23.9 on pod 4. Several\ndoses of Prograf were held and resumed on  when the trough\nlevel was 10.6.\n\nPT evaluated him and felt that he was safe for discharge home\nwithout PT. He became ambulatory without assist.\n\n surgery was called on  given recent left fem-ant\ntib bypass with PTFE in . Of note, pulses were as\nfollows: RLE fem 2+  PT-MP\nLLE fem 2+ DP=MP PT-Non-dopp\nL great toe ulcer, not infected and heal ulcer, not infected.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Ms.  is a 78 y/o with Raynaud's, no significant heart or\nlung history who presented from   with\nintermittent fevers and fatigue for 3 weeks and parasite smear +\nfor babesiosis and SOB.\n\n# Fevers, malaise: The patient had a parasite smear at positive for babesiosis. Fatigue and fevers were consistent with\nBabesiosis, as was recent tick exposure. New onset anemia and\nthrombocytopenia were also consistent. The patient was treated\nwith Atovaquone and Azithro for Babesiosis. She was also treated\nwith Doxycycline for possibly Lyme disease - it was continued\nwhen her Lyme titer came back positive. The patient's fevers\ntrended down and malaise improved during hospitalization. Abx\nwere continued after discharge. Erlichia smear is negative.\n\n#  Pulmonary edema: The patient was admitted with dyspnea, which\ndeveloped in setting of IVF and new onset PAF. The patient\nlikely had flash pulmonary edema, given her lung findings,\nelevated JVP, h/o valvulopathy, and new onset arrthymia. ECHO\nshowed moderate aortic regurgitation. She diuresed well with\nlasix. ARDS was possible in the setting of Babesiosis, but\nunlikely since the patient had other signs of heart failure and\nhad minimal oxygen requirement. When the patient was transferred\nfrom the MICU to the floor, she no longer had SOB and did not\nrequire oxygen. Diuresis was held, as the patient was breathing\nat baseline, but she was kept on fluid restriction.\n\n#  Hyponatremia: The patient was admitted with Na level 120. Her\nexam was consistent with hypervolemic hyponateremia. The Na\nlevel trended up with diuresis and fluid restriction, and was\n132 on discharge.\n\n# PAF: The patient had new onset Afib  and spontaneously\nconverted back to NSR. She was started on Lovenox in the MICU,\nbut it was discontinued since she developed afib in the setting\nof an infection and spontaneously converted back to NSR. On\ntransfer to the floor, the patient was back in atrial\nfibrillation with RVR, HR 130-140s. She was treated with\nMetoprolol IV and responded well both times. The patient\nspontaneously converted back to NSR again. She was kept on PO\nMetoprolol. Due to low CHADS2 score, the patient was kept on ASA\nfor anticoagulation.\n\n#  Anemia: The patient had a low HCT during her hospitalization.\nThere was no obvious GI bleed. This was likely  to hemolysis\nin the setting of Babesiosis. Her HCT was monitored, and she did\nnot require any transfusions during her hospitalization.",

She was immediately\nbegun on a heparin drip upon admission to the ICU with her PTT\nclosely monitored. ENT took the patient for sinus debridement\nand cultures on , for which her heparin drip was briefly\nstopped.  Cultures were significant for pan-sensitive E.coli.\nNeurology and ophthalmology noted a partial CNIII deficit as\nwell as a CNVI deficit, which improved and resolved during her\nadmission. She had nasal packing placed by ENT - to be removed\non , . Neurology recommended follow-up brain scans\nas an outpatient in 1 month. She was started on coumadin 5 mg in\nthe ICU to start her 3-month course of anticoagulation.  Her INR\nwill be followed by her PCP.\n\n2.

On\nhospital day 2 she was found to be awake, alert and orientated\nX3, without pronator drift or motor deficits.  Her dilantin\nlevel was 16.6. A repeat CT showed left parietal, frontal, and\nright frontal hemorrhagic contusions. These appeared slightly\nmore prominent than on the prior study. Again identified was a\nsmall amount of blood in the occipital  of the right lateral\nventricle. The left convexity subdural hematoma appeared\nunchanged in size. There was effacement of sulci and minimal\nleft to right midline shift.\n\nHer family asked that patient have a more conservative approach\nrather than surgery and she was called out of the ICU to the\nfloor.  On , neurology was consulted after an episode of\nconfusion lasting one day, now resolved.  She had some\nword-finding difficulties and was subsequently transferred to\nthe Stroke service for work-up of possible vascular event after\nrepeat head CT showed unchanged bleeds. The language\ndifficulties resolved over 2-3 days and were felt to be due to\nsome left temporal lobe contusion.\n\nUpon evaluation by neurology, her mental status was intact,\nwithout evidence of inattention, confusion, dysarthria, or\naphasia. She did have a R pronator drift, likely from her SDH,\nbut otherwise no focal neurologic findings. She also had some\nend gaze nystagmus, likely  Dilantin.\n\nOf note, her confusion started around the same time as her\nepisode of paroxsymal A fib, however she was reportedly\nhemodynamically stable.  Differential included\ninfectious/toxic/metabolic, stroke (carotid disease v\ncardioembolic) or seizure.\n\n1. Neuro: On MRI Head, there is no evidence of an acute infarct.\n There was a small amount of edema noted adjacent to the\nintraparenchymal hemorrhages.  No additional lesions were\nidentified.

Patient will need further risk factor modification\nfor secondary prevention with better BP and lipid control.\n\n# LE Cramping/ poor peripheral pulses: On review of symptoms,\npatient complained of lower extremity cramping with exertion,\npoor dorsal pedial pulses, and symptoms concerning for lower\nextremity ischemia upon femoral artery vascular access.  ABI\nshowed severe flow deficit of right lower extremity and\nsignificant left tibial disease. This will need to followed as\nan outpatient and referral to vascular surgery may be\nappropriate.\n\n#. s/p endotracheal intubation: Patient was emergently intubated\nfollowing post-arrest agitation for airway protection; requiring\nminimal ventilatory support.  Following resolution of\ncardiogenic shock, patient was successfully extubated on .\nImmediately following extubation, patient transientally\ndesaturated to mid 80s from mild pulmonary edema and mucus\nplugging with possible VAP.  Treated successfully with lasix and\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics.  Respiratory status improved with\nlasix and by  he was no longer requiring supplemental O2.\n\n#. Elevated CK: Upon admission, patient had CK elevated to 2604\nwhich trended up to 8716 during course of hospitalization.\nEtiology was multifactorial from myocardial infarction, muscle\ninjury from cardiac resuscitation and early lower extremity\nischemia during intra-aortic balloon pump placement.  Myocardial\nischemia was treated as above.  CK trended down once balloon\npump was removed.  Renal function was trended and there was no\nevidence of myoglobinuria or renal injury associated with\nelevated CK.\n\n#.  Fever: on , patient developed fever to 101.5.\nInfectious evaluation with blood culture, urinalysis/ culture,\nsputum culture and CXR was concerning for ventilator associated\nPNA. Groin lines (IABP, a-line) also may have been source of\ninfection/ fever.  Patient was started on broad spectrum\nantibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime for HAP/ possible line\ninfection. Sputum culture was growing GNR and GPCs.  Fever curve\nand WBC count was trended.\n\n#. Transaminitis: Likely shock liver in the setting of VF arrest\nwith cardiogenic shock. LFTs trended down thoughout his\nhospitalization. Patient's underlying alcohol abuse may have\nalso contributed to elevated LFTs.",

She was started on her home cardiac\nregimen of metoprolol XL 25mg once daily on  AM.\nThroughout the course of the day of , the pt continued to\nhave a HR of 40s to 50s with systolic blood pressure of 110-130s\nand some degree of mental status change with lethargy. On\n at 22:23, a trigger was called for a heart rate of 30s\nwith SBP of 100s. The NF intern was called to assess the pt and\nfound the pt to be completely obtunded and unresponsive to\nverbal or physical stimuli (sternal rub) with GCS score of .\nThe pt was given atropine 0.5mg x3 as well as glucagon 5mg x2,\n3mg x1 and calcium 1 amp without effect. The son who was present\nat the time confirmed, this was a far cry from her mother's\nbaseline mental status where she is normally communicative.\n\nDuring transfer to the  and placement of foley catheter and\narterial line, the HR increased to 40s-50s with increase in\nsystolic blood pressure to 110-140s. In addition, the pt\nregained some degree of mental status and was able to interact.\nShe remained with HR >30 in the , without further\nobtundation.  All beta blockers were held.\n\n1. Bradycardia - Likely due to conduction abnormality rather\nthan BB. Initially patient had HR in the 30's with MS changes\nand low BP.  For remainder of the hospital course, HR in 50's\nwith few episodes in 30's. Her EKGs show afib with slow\nventricular response. Per cardiology consult, no need for\ntranscutaneous pacer was warranted given her poor prognosis.\nBradycardia may be secondary to intrinsic conduction disease vs.\nvagal response. Likely not  to BB given that last dose was on\n.\n\n2. Mental status changes - Initial obtundation likely  poor\nperfusion from bradycardia. CT of head  was negative.\nInfectious work-up was also negative from admission.  Considered\nMRI/MRA to evaluate for further progression of vascular dementia\nif mental status were to deteriorate; however, MS improved back\nto baseline after bradycardia resolved.\n\n3. CAD - Pt had no symptoms of CP, and helding BB in setting of\nbradycardia, although this would be beneficial in CAD.  Per PCP,\n held  h/o GI bleed while pt was on both  and coumadin.\n Imdur was also changed to isosorbide dinitrate as imdur cannot\nbe crushed.\n\n4. Afib - Held coumadin for supertherapeutic INR; restarted when\nINR<2.\n\n5. CHF - Pt has h/o CHF with unknown EF; baseline TTE during\nthis hospitalization showed EF >55%.  Continued lasix and\nnitrate; recommended monitoring of daily weights.\n\n6. Aspiration PNA - Pt had no signs of PNA on CXR, but pt was\nadmitted with fevers and productive cough concerning for URI.\nHas a h/o aspiration PNA in the past. Pt was started on\nlevofloxacin on initial admission and completed a 7 day course.\nShe had a speech and swallow evaluation: they recommended thin\nliquid and purees, with assistance while eating, crushed meds,\nbasic aspiration precautions.\n\n7.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of  transfer, , patient\nhad some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his\ndaughter of heartburn. Of note, he was on daily indocin while on\nIL-2 therapy. At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had\nan episode of nausea and vomiting. The covering MD noted 2 very\nlarge blood clots in the emesis. Noted increased RR of 40s, was\n84% on RA and then improved to 100% on 4L NC. Biologics\nattending was not concerned about other parameters, but was\nworried about bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding\ngiven his plts have dropped in the past few days.\n.\nBrought to , GI team requested FFP, plts. Pt has guiac\npositive brown stools, and complained of hemorrhoids and some\nrectal irritation that may be contributing. He was not scoped\nemergently that night, and his vitals were closely followed,\nalong with Hct.  His Hct was noted to be stable, with stable VS,\nand no episodes of melena.  GI felt no emergent need for EGD.\nHe is receiving PPI .  On , the pt was intubated for\nrespiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema thought to be\nsecondary to capillary leak syndrome from HD IL-2.  He underwent\ndiuresis and was started on levo/flagyl for ?LLL PNA, started\n.  On , levo/flagyl d/c'd as all cx negative, pt\nafebrile.  Another reason abx d/c'd was b/c pt developed a rash\nthought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which improved\npost d/c abx.  ID was consulted  for continued fevers and\nrecommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl.\nVancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped ), RUQ US to r/o\ncholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give\nsteroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm\nsource.  Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w\npulm edema vs. PNA.  Pt underwent Bronch , showing limited\neval of right sided airways, lavage with RLL post segment,\nresult: no PMN, no microorg, grew OP flora, PCP negative, AFB\nnegative.  Vancomycin was continued for ? line infection, and\nb/c the pt had difficult access, his line was continued for 19\ndays.  He has been on Vanco for 8 days. The pt's LFT elevation\nwas attributed to IL-2 therapy, a known side effect.\n.\nAlso, he was noted to have renal insufficiency, with Cr to 1.6,\nand eosinophilia, with presumed AIN.  His creatinine continued\nto rise to 2.6 (baseline 0.9).  He was given prednisone, which\nwas subsequently d/c'd.  Renal was consulted  and\nrecommended for pt to increase free water intake.  They felt he\nhad a number of reasons to have ARF, including: capillary leak\nsyndrome, NSAIDs, infection, contrast on , and drug reaction\nthough no eos or WBC in urine.  The pt's creatinine demonstrated\nslow improvement, was 1.4 , and on transfer from ICU, his Cr\nwas 0.9 (baseline).\n.\nSubjectively on transfer from  to the medical floor, the pt\nfelt well, is laughing and joking with family, and has no pain\ncomplaints.  States his breathing if fine.  No cough, fever,\nchills.  No N/V.  No abd pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  No\ndysuria.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n________________________________________________________________\nImpression:  A/P: 69 M with metastatic melanoma s/p IL-2\ntherapy, last dose at 3 pm , now with fevers, resp failure\n non-cardiogenic pulm edema; now improving, extubated ,\nand satting well on NC.  Resolved ARF.  s/p Drug\nhypersensitivity reaction with discontinuation of all\nantibiotics and improvement.\n.\n#. Pulmonary status s/p respiratory distress: Mr.  was\nintubated initially  for resp distress, thought secondary to\nnon-cardiogenic pulm edema from capillary leak syndrome from\nIl-2, with possible contribution from PNA. LLL inbfiltrate on\nCXR, fevers, but sputum never grew anything, so unclear if PNA\nvs atalectasis. He was intially started on levaquin and flagyl.\nChest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs PNA.\nLenis were neg, but he did not have a CTA because of renal\nfailure. He has no h/o CHF, COPD or asthma. No Echo on file. The\npt was then taken off all abx on  because all cx data was\nnegative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial\nnephritis given eosinophilia, ARF, rash versus due to his\nmelanoma and IL'2 treatment. ID was consulted, recommended\nbronchoscopy and labs, empiric sntibiotics for presumed Hospital\nacquired PNA vs. line infection, so he was started on\nvancomycin. Bronchoscopy from  was negative. He remained on\nvancomycin for 8 days until his central line was pulled.  We\nthen discontinued Vancomycin IV.\n-now on room air, sats stable\n-nebs prn if needed\n-chest PT, mobilize secretions\n-IS to bedside and encourage pt to use\n.\n# ARF, resolved: this was thought to be acute interstitial\nnephritis given fever, rash and ARF with peripheral\neosinophilia. However, eos negative in urine. Renal consulted\nfelt to be pre-renal also question contrast induced nephropathy.\nThis fully resolved with hydration, so finally appeared to be\nmost likely pre-renal and contrast related.  His creatinine\ncontinued to be at his baseline.  We ended up restarting his\noutpatient ACEI.  Will see PCP  1 week.\n.\n# Fever: Unclear etiology still, all cultures negative. He has\nbeen hemodynamically stable. ID was consulted in the setting of\ncontemplating starting steroids.  ID recomended to r/o infection\nBAL prior to starting empiric antibiotics, multiples serologies\nhistoplasma antigen, EBV viral load, CMV viral load, cryptococal\nantigen, Strongiloides serology. RUQ u/s. All work up\nunrevealing to date, and fevers tapered off. Afebrile for 6 days\nprior to leaving ICU. Initial empiric a/b regimen with flagyl,\naztreonam and vanco was D/C'd .  He has remained afebrile on the\nmedical floor and has been instructed to report to the ED for\nfever, chills.\n.\n#. Hypernatremia, resolved: Likely due to increase insensible\nlossess. Free water boluses and D5w was given with normalization\nof sodium.\n.\n#. ?Line infection:  Pt was continuing to spike fevers in the\nICU with a negative panculture workup and no infiltrate.  Other\nsources excluded, so IV vamco empirically given.   His line was\npulled, no drainage and erythema at site.  His blood cx are\nnegative to date.  We stopped IV vancomycin on transfer to\nmedical floor, no evidence to support its use.\n.\n#. Metastatic Melanoma:  Il-2 therapy on hold for now. Plan per\nOnc team, attending Dr.  and .  His restaging lung\nCT, head CT showed only mediastinal nodes largest 1.7 cm, could\nnot assess for pulm nodules given pulm edema.  The pt has follow\nup with Dr. .\n.\n#. GI Bleed:  The pt had emesis with large clots on . No\nfurther bleeding, hct has since remained stable stable. The pt\ncan continue his PPI.  His Hct has remained stable, as well as\nhis vital signs.\n.\n#. Elevated LFTs: stable.  This is a known side effect of IL-2\ntherapy.  We held his IL-2, and trended his LFTs, which improved\nover time.\n.\n#  Confusion/ICU psychosis:  Pt had vivid dreams as well as\nhallucinations while in the ICU, and would often speak\ninappropriately at times or answer questions with responses\nunrelated.  He was started on low dose haldol.  On the medical\nfloor, the pt was appropriate in conversation, but would\noccasionally state things that he was going to \" to herd\ncattle.\"  On questioning his family, they stated that he has no\nplans for a trip.  He is otherwise appropriate.  He has an\nappointment to follow up with his PCP  1 week. His haldol was\nnot given while he was on the medical floor.\n.\n#. Communication: with pt, wife and daughter .\n#. Nutrition:\nThe pt initially failed his speech and swallow study, however\nthe study was done a few hours post extubation, when the pt\nstill had copious secretions.  At the time of transfer to the\nmedical floor, the pt was swallowing and chewing fine.  He did\nnot experience any choking or coughing episodes with eating, and\nhe is tolerating a po diet well.  We did not repeat his swallow\nstudy.  He does not appear to be an aspiration risk now.\n.\n#. Access: RSC multi-lumen  discontinued, now with pIV\n.\n#. Code: full\n.\n#.

A   potential cause could\nhave been general anesthesia he tolerated the procedure\nunderlying poor baseline systolic function secondary to systolic\ncongestive heart failure. His baseline systolic blood pressures\nare usually between 95-110 as per patient.  We monitored\nhemodynamics while in the ICU with goal MAPs > 65.\nWe held home eplerenone, isosorbide, lisinopril, torsemide, and\noxycodone overnight pending resolution of blood pressures. He wa\nweaned off his dopamine drip and tolerated well with increase in\nsystolic blood pressure to 100-110.\n.\n# Ventricular tachycardia- Patient with monomorphic ventricular\ntachycardia, now with ICD in place.  S/p catheter ablation with\nRFA of 2 foci.  Will continue home sotalol and metoprolol as\nadjunctive therapy.  Most likely caused by arrythmic substrate\nfrom past myocardial infarctions.  We monitored hemodynamics\novernight which remained stable. The patient remained in AV\npaced rhythm.\n.\n#Atrial fibrillation/ LV thrombus-Stopped coumadin for case.\n- We gave lovenox 1mg/kg . and started warfarin home dose as\nwell fr anticoagulation.\n.\n# Respiratory Acidosis - Patient did not look short of breath on\npresentation. In fact, the ABG sample which indicates\nrespiratory acidosis was done intra operatively under anesthesia\n. The patient never felt short of breath in CCU and his O2\nsaturation  on room air was  96&.\n.\n#Left fem- bypass/PVD- Had poor lower extremity pulses which\nis consistent with baseline (1+ Left DP and 1+ Right DP) . We\nConsidered vascular consult if patient has cold extremities or\nany other signs of very poor perfusion. However he was found to\nhave pulses on  bilaterally in lower extremities, during\nhis stay in the CCU.\n.\n#Ventricular fibrillation\n- has  and  Biventricular ICD-.\n#HTN- Continued home medications\n.\n#Hyperlipidemia-Continued home medications\n.\n#Ischemic cardiomyopathy-EF 15% on last echocardiogram - and  CABG\n- cardiac catheterization:Occluded LAD, LCX and RCA.\nLIMA to LAD with minor luminal irregularities.Y graft with SVG\nfrom the aorta to first OM and diagonal was aneurismal proximal.\n\nDiffuse disease of LIMA to OM.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "80yo F w/ history of TIA symptoms in the past not anticoagulated\nwho initially presented to  for left neglect and\nfound to have ECG changes and TnT elevation to 0.13 and\ntransferred to  for management of NSTEMI after being\nstarted on a heparin IV infusion at the OSH. Upon presentation\nto , the patient was noted to have coffee ground emesis as\nwell as left hemi-neglect with left parietal drift and mid left\nhemiparesis  and stroke work-up was initially sought and\nreturned negative for an acute infarct. Given this, concern was\nfor seizures and patient was presumptively treated with keppra\nwith marked improvement in symptoms. EEG showed multifocal\nepileptiform activity in addition to clinical seizures with RUE\nshaking and patient was commenced on keppra with improvement of\nher EEG. Patient had further visual phenomena in her left visual\nfield concerning for seizures and keppra dose was increased. EGD\nshowed gastric and esophageal erosions with\ngastritis/esophagitis and patient was commenced on high dose PPI\nand will be followed by GI. Myocardial perfusion scan was\nnegative and TnT elevation was considered more likely a\nconsequence of her seizures. She has neurology follow-up and was\ndischarged with services on .\n.\n# Multifocal seizures:\nPatient initially presented as transfer from   after\nshe was noticed by her son to be confused with nausea and\nvomiting on . At that time, patient was noted by her son to\nbe ignoring the left hand side. There were also memory issues\nregarding remembering phone numbers. There was no apparent\nlanguage disorder or aphasia or dysarthria or report of\nweakness. When the patient was more able, she described having\nbrief episodes where she felt distant and disconnected and not\nherself lasting <1 minute on the day of presentation. Of\nparticular mention, she had a low velocity motor vehicle\ncollision on  when she was exiting a supermarket and a car\nhit her from the left hand side. She had no head injury or loss\nof consciousness although had worsening of a right sided\nheadache after this. The headache was still present at the time\nof discharge.   CT-head showed extensive\nperiventricular small vessel disease and multiple areas of\nhypodensities in the centrum semioval region (on both sides,\nleft more than right). On arrival to , neurology were\nconsulted regarding left neglect. She had been commenced on IV\nheparin at OSH given previous atrial septal aneurysm and (at\nthat time) likely NSTEMI given TnT elevation to 0.12 and shortly\nthereafter developed coffee-ground emesis On neurological\nreview, patient had a mild left hemiparesis and severe left\nneglect with left parietal drift and no language disturbance. As\nthere was obvious concern regarding possible stroke and new GI\nbleeding, she was briefly transferred to the MICU for\nmonitoring. She was transferred out of the ICU to the floor and\nproceeded to MRI-head which showed no acute infarct but\nextensive small vessel disease and heparin was stopped. In the\nabsence of other cause and given transient symptoms, patient was\nmonitored on EEG LTM and was presumptively treated with keppra\n500mg IV x1 for likely seizures. After this, the patient had a\ndramatic improvement in symptoms with almost complete resolution\nof her neglect although also seemed to have some variable right\nsided neglect in addition which latterly resolved. She was then\ncontinued on po keppra 500mg . Of note, she was mostly\namnestic of the events of the day of admission. EEG showed\ninitially marked suppression of electrical activity broadly\npresent over the right hemisphere felt to be post-ictal in\nnature in addition to electrographic and clinical seizures in\nthe left posterior frontal temporal region associated with\nclinical correlate with rhythmic movement of the right hand and\none seizure lasting 10-15 seconds, on the other two lasting\nabout 25 seconds with post-octal right parietal depression in\naddition to inter-ictal right parietal discharges. Further EEGs\nshowed the striking left-right voltage asymmetry improved and\nthere was inter-ictal epileptiform activity from the left\nposterior frontal and anterior temporal and left frontal central\nregion and some of these were associated with brief jerking in\nthe right UE and latterly multifocal left-sided epileptic\nactivity with fairly significant inter-ictal discharges from the\nright parietal occipital area which gradually improved. She was\ntaken off LTM on .  She had repeated MRI  and w/o contrast\nwhich showed no significant contrast enhancement. She improved\nclinically with left neglect but began to notice intermittent\nodd sensory symptoms with seeing balloons and a lace pattern in\nher left visual field concerning for seizures. We Increased\nkeppra to 750mg  sensory symptoms seemed to resolve. On\ndischarge, she had considerably improved and previous errors in\nvisuospatial testing were greatly improved but continued to have\nsignificant cognitive impairment but attentional issues had\nimproved, able to   back in 12 seconds, skipping one.. She\nwas fully oriented and left hemiparesis had essentially resolved\nin addition to left neglect, with no reproducible extinction to\ndouble simultaneous stimulation. The etiology of her seizures\nwas ut down to her large burden of small vessel disease. She was\ndischarged on  to home with services. She has neurology\nfollow-up.\n\n# Upper GI bleed: Coffee ground emesis on the floor while on\nheparin drip for NSTEMI and for presumed stroke, but none after\ntransfer to MICU. Hct remained stable initially at around 34 but\nslowly downtrended. IV Pantoprazole started for UGIB,\nhematemesis resolved and had no melena. Aspirin and nadolol were\ninitially held and restarted later in her hospital stay. Heparin\ndrip was initially continued for possible stroke but after MRI\ndid not show evidence of this, this was discontinued. UGIE on\n showed showed evidence of erosions in the stomach with\ngastritis and G-E junction erosion compatible with reflux\nesophagitis and H pylori Ab testing was negative. She was\ntransitioned from IV PPI to po omeprazole 40mg  which she\nwill continue for 2 weeks and then change to 40mg qd thereafter.\nHb slowly decreased and was Hb 8.6 HCt 27 on discharge. This\nshould be monitored by her PCP  . She has GI follow-up.\n\n# Possible NSTEMI: Patient with elevated troponin at OSH with\nnegative MB. Patient with ECG changes at OSH: ST depressions\n~1mm in V2 and V4-V6. Troponin at  at 0.12 with negative MB\nfraction and TnT max was 0.13. ST segment depressions were more\npronounced in leads V3-V6 when compared with ECG at  and were suggestive of antero-lateral ischemia. Troponin\nand ECGs were trended. Heparin drip continued but then\ndiscontinued as above. Given high risk of UGIB with\nanticoagulation it was decided to treat medically since she was\n>48 hours outside event. TnT downtrended and CK-MB remained\nflat. Echo showed no clear focal wall motion abnormality\nalthough this could not be ruled out given technical quality\nhowever, LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic\nfunction were normal (LVEF 65%). Patient had a Persantine\nPharmacologic stress on  which was negative and therefore\nit is unclear as to the cause of her TnT elevation and ECG\nchanges but may have been secondary to seizures as opposed to\ncardiac ischemia.\n\n# Atrial Septal Aneurysm and Patent Foramen Ovale: Last ECHO at\n in  showing atrial septal aneurysm present with right\nto left shunting with Valsalva. ECHO with bubble study performed\nduring this admission to evaluate for presence of thrombi and\nPFO/Atrial septal aneurysm did not show PFO but TTE was limited\nand no focal wall motion abnormalities. Given evidence of PFO\nfound on TTE in the past there was felt no need for a TEE. ASA\n325mg daily for primary prevention of stroke given PFO was\nstarted and given GI bleeding was discharged on 81mg home dose.\nNo need for repair of PFO.\n\n#Hyponatremia: Na downtrending 131 on admission -> 125. Uosm 538\nand Sosm 262 and UNa of 212 on admission. After 500cc bolus her\nUNa improved to 23 and serum Na increased to 129. After further\nboluses, her Na remained stable and discharge Na was 139.\n\n#Depression: Continued home Citalopram 30mg, Nortriptyline 25mg,\nBuspirone 10mg",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "In the MICU pt abx regiment was changed to vanc and meropenem\ndue to the hx of (MSSA and) enterobacter.  Was also followed by\nthe renal service due to ARF with a creatinine bump to 2.4, was\nmanaged with gentle fluid rehydration with return of systolic bp\ninto 130s.  Had cotrosyn stim test to test for adrenal\ninsufficiency as a cause of hypotension; was normal.\nHypotension possibly related to patient being on BB with\nworsening renal failure but may also have been due to sepsis\nalthough blood culutures did not grow out positive. Also,\nlactate was normal making ischemia due unlikely as a cause.  Pt\nswelling, pain and redness with great improvement; pt was\ntherefore transferred to the floor on CC7.\n.\nPt continued to improve on the floor; her renal function quickly\nreturned to  with a creatinine of 1.8; she remained\nafebrile for the remainder of the stay.  A source of infection\nwas never clearly identified.  Bladder and respiratory\ninfections were thought very unlikely given normal studies.  Pt\nhad no GI sx's.  ID thought source of fever was most likely the\nL 4th finger with a gout lesion that was superinfected.  Since\ncultures of this had grown out enterobacter and MSSA (although a\nhx of MRSA) vanc and meropenem was continued.  Cellulitis of the\nR leg was thought possible although less likely as a cause of\nfever.  Later in the stay pt was refusing PICC placement and was\ndemanding to go home.  Pt had expressed discontent with numerous\nthing during the hospitalization up to this point, one of them\nbeing the experience with the plastic surgery team during their\nvisit (recommended soaking the finger qid for 15 minutes in warm\nwater and taking off ring).  Despite numerous conversations with\nthe intern, the resident, the attending, the transplent team,\nthe entire ID team, pt clearly stated she would leave that day\nand do so without a PICC.\n.\nThe following is a summary of the contants of the conversation\nheld with patient prior to discharge: We have decreased your\ngabapentin dose to 300 daily, decreased your cellcept to 500\ntwice a day (since so far out and ID thought this may help with\nfighting infection). We have also changed your calcitriol to 0.5\nmcg twice a day, your Sodium bicarbonate to 650mg three times a\nday, and decreased your metoprolol to 12.5 mg twice a day.We\nhave recommended that you have a PICC line placed for IV\nantibiotics, however you have refused. Instead, we have\ndeveloped an alternative plan as below. You should also start\ntaking your linezolid on the evening of sunday  until you\nare out of pills. Start your ciprofloxacin tonight and continue\nuntil you are out of pills. You need to understand that this is\nnot the optimal therapy as you may not absorb the linezolid as\nwell as an IV antibiotic. In addition, linezolid can cause\ndecreaased platelets, for which you are already at high risk.\nYou will need to have MWF blood counts to monitor your platelets\nwith your VNA until one week after you finish your linezolid\ndosing. They will send the results to Dr.  for review. We\nalso strongly recommend that you schedule an MRI for your finger\nto make sure there is no osteomyelitis as well as an\nechocardiagram to make sure you do not have endocarditis. Please\nschedule these tests on Monday.\n.\nWhen patient left on  she was urinating on own, was off\nsupplemental oxygen, afebrile and eating and drinking on her\nown.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "47 yo woman with  syndrome, s/p colectomy with\nshort-gut syndrome requiring TPN via indwelling tunnelled\nfemoral hickman with recurrent line infections p/w abdominal\npain, nausea, increased ostomy output, and recent fever c/w\nprior episodes of bacteremia and word finding difficulty.\n\n1. Sepsis:\nHer presenting symptoms of abdominal pain, increased ostomy\noutput, and nausea were consistent with prior presentations of\nbacteremia.  Given that she had not yet completed a course of\ndaptomycin for MRSE (scheduled to end on ) and her past\nmultiple line infections, she was presumptively treated for\nmicrobial infecions.  She was initially continued on daptomycin.\n\nShe was last admitted in early  with a\nmethicillin-resistant coag-negative staph (MRSE) infection of a\ntunneled and a peripheral line. The tunneled line was changed\nover a wire by IR. She was started on four weeks of daptomycin,\nand discharged with ongoing daptomycin and ethanol dwells into\nthe left femoral line.\n\nOn the night of , she had a temperature of 102.6. Cefepime\nwas started in addition to her ongoing daptomycin. Shortly\nafterward, she developed hypotension with SBP 80s in the setting\nof copious output into her ostomy bag. She was transferred\nbriefly to the ICU for further monitoring. Given her additional\nrecent history of Malassezia bacteremia, she was started on\nfluconazole in addition to the daptomycin and cefepime.  These\nantibiotics were broadened further to Daptomycin, Meropenem, and\nAmbisone per ID recs. In the MICU, Ms.  was requiring\nlevophed to maintain her blood pressures, which was transitioned\nto vasopressin, then titrated off after 3 total days on\npressors.  She required 4L NC O2 occasionally to maintain\ncomfort.  She was transferred back to a general medicine floor\non .\n\nWhen she arrived on the general medicine floor, her SBP was in\nthe 80s and 90s with occasional tachycardia to the 100s or low\n110s.  The hypotension quickly responded to several 500cc normal\nsaline fluid boluses.  She was afebrile throughout her stay on\nthe floor.  Etiology of her sepsis remained unclear as she had\nnegative blood cultures throughout her stay.  TTE was performed\nfor evaluation of endocarditis but did not demonstrate\nvegetations. TEE was considered; however proceeding with TEE was\nthought to be of high risk given patient's difficulty tolerating\nEGD at an OSH.  Given these risks, TEE was not pursued.\n\nTreatment was discussed with infectious disease physicians and\ntheir recommendations were to continue animicrobial treatment\nfor 4-6 weeks or until infectious disease follow-up.  They\nrecommended treatment with daptomycin given past bacterial\ninfections and fluconazole for past fungal infections.\nIt was also recommended that the patient maintain good hygiene\nwith respect to the PICC line.  After completing TPN the line\nshould be flushed with normal saline, then allowed for 2 hours\nof ethanol dwell, and then either restarted allowed to have\nheparin dwell in the meantime.\n\n2. Access:\nMs.  has a double-lumen tunneled Hickman catheter last\nchanged on  by IR. Due to her need for pressors, fluid\nboluses, antibiotics, blood products, and chronic TPN, she had a\ntemporary Quad-lumen central line catheter placed in the left\nfemoral vein for extra access proximal to her tunneled\ndouble-lumen Hickman.  Prior to the quad-lumen placement, the\nTPN line was violated for administration of cefepime and packed\nred blood cells; the patient could not tolerate antibiotics\nthrough the same port as the levophed, even though compatible --\nshe complained of headaches.  The Quad-lumen was removed on\n after a 4 day stay on the general medicine floor without\nneed for pressor support.\n\n3. Sub-Acute Stroke vs Septic Emboli:\nWord finding difficulty was noted by patient to be new over on\nthe about 1 week prior to admission.  CT Head was performed and\ndemonstrated areas of hypodensity in L basal ganglia and L\ncerebellum.  These locations however are unlikely to cause the\nword-finding difficulties that the patient was experiencing.\nMRI would have been a preferred follow-up imaging study, but\npatient cannot tolerate MRI studies due to iodine reaction and\nmetal hardware.  As described above, there was concern for\nendocarditis predisposing the patient to having septic emboli to\nthe brain and resulting in these neurologic symptoms.  Given\nhistory of clots, there was also concern for thromboembolism.\nBoth neurology and cardiology were involved.  Neurology team did\nnot believe this to be a subacute stroke.  The Neurology team\ninitially suggested Lumbar puncture while the patient was\nseptic.  This was deferred in the ICU because broad spectrum\nantibiotics were already being given, and the patient did not\nappear meningitic.  The LP was never performed as the patient's\ncondition improved.  The patient was scheduled for a TEE to\nevaluate for left to right communication predisposing to\narterial clots and valvularvegetations.  Given her history of\ndysphagia, the Trans Esophageal Echocardiogram was not performed\nas it would have first required an EGD and then a TEE, both of\nwhich would have required general anesthesia in this patient.\n\n4. Anemia: She was guaiac positive at her ostomy on .\nShe was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs in the ICU for a Hct of 19 on\n.\n\nDNR/DNI, confirmed with pt.",

She was afebrile\nand without leukocytosis, no focal signs of infection.  CXR\nclear, no other localizing signs or symptoms.  U/A bland.  LFTs\ndemonstrated an obstructive picture.  CT torso was performed\nwith premedication to evaluate for metastatic and/or locally\nprogressive disease.  It showed neither of these but did\ndeonstrate possible biliary ductal dilatation.  ERCP evaluated\nher and recommended ERCP to evaluate the patency of stent and\nother ducts.  She underwent ERCP, during which her previous\nbiliary stent was removed and replaced.  After her ERCP\nprocedure, she was being prepared for discharge but developed a\nfever.  Blood cultures were drawn and were positive for\nSerratia.  She was started on cefepime and flagyl.  A CT scan\nwas performed and showed abscesses in the liver.  This was\nconfirmed with abdominal ultrasound, but it was felt that the\nabscesses were not amenable to IR drainage.  She ultimately\nunderwent a repeat ERCP.  During the repeat ERCP, her biliary\nstent was seen to be adjacent to the duodenum and eroding into\nthe duodenal wall.  Out of concern for duodenal perforation, no\nintervention was performed during this ERCP.  However, the\npatient's alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels continued to\nrise during this time.  Of note, during this time as well, the\npatient's more recent blood cultures began to grow enterococcus.\n She was started on vancomycin in addition to the\ncefepime/flagyl.  On , because her alk phos and bilirubin\nwere still rising, the patient underwent a 3rd ERCP, during\nwhich a defect was created in the distal portion of her previous\nstent so that bile could drain into the duodenum.  On the\nfollowing evening (), while she was talking to her family,\nthe patient's eyes rolled back in her head, and she suddenly\nbecame tired and short of breath.  She was also noted to be\nsomewhat hypotensive.  While she was being evaluation, she had\nan episode of bright red bloody stool.  Stat labs were drawn and\nrevealed a 5-point hematocrit drop.  The patient was started on\nIV fluids as well as blood.  She was transferred to the were she was found to have stopped bleeding.  A tagged RBC scan\nwas performed which revealed no clear source of bleeding.\nUnfortunately she bled again overnight, and the family and\npatient were offered a repeat RBC scan.  At this time the family\nand patient got together and decided that they no longer wanted\nto escalate care.  The patient was set-up with hospice care and\nprepared to go home comfortably with her family.\n\n# Cholangiocarcinoma:  Locally advanced and unresectable but\nstable in appearance by CT , s/p 7 cycles of gemcitabine\n(most recent ) and Cyberknife ().  There was no\nevidence of metastatic disease on CT torso.

Slightly improved right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Tip of the endotracheal tube is in\nstandard placement, approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  Cuff\nis no longer as severely hyperinflated.  Lungs are clear.  Heart\nsize top normal.  No pleural abnormality.  Nasogastric tube ends\nin the upper stomach.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): 1.  Endotracheal tube terminating\n6.4 cm above the carina.  More optimal positioning would be\nachieved if the tube is advanced 1-2 cm. 2.  Overdistention of\nthe endotracheal tube cuff at the thoracic inlet.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Pulmonary vascular congestion,\nincreased since prior examination.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Dobbhoff tube now in the expected\nlocation of the gastric fundus.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Feeding tube has been withdrawn to\nthe level of the thoracic inlet that needs to be repositioned.\nET tube is in standard placement.  Heart size top normal.\nPulmonary vascular congestion has improved.  Lungs are\nessentially clear though low in volume.  There is no pleural\nabnormality.\n.\n CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1. Stable appearance of bilateral\nintraventricular hemorrhages and of intraparenchymal hemorrhages\nwithin the right centrum ovale and recent catheter tract.  2.\nStatus post ventriculostomy removal.\n.\n LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: No ascites.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Mediastinal and pulmonary venous\ncongestion are new, and mild cardiomegaly has worsened,\nconsistent with cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload.\nLungs are low in volume but clear of any focal abnormality.  ET\ntube is in standard placement and a feeding tube ends in the\nupper stomach.\n.\n CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:\n1. New hemorrhage along the catheter tract, extending into the\nleft frontal  of the lateral ventricle.  Otherwise, no\nsignificant interval change.\n2. No evidence of hydrocephalus.\n.\n RENAL U.S. PORT: No evidence of hydronephrosis.\n.\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Endotracheal tube located\napproximately 6 cm above the carina, as detailed above.\n.\n BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No DVT.\n.\n CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 1. New hemorrhage along the\ncatheter tract, extending into the left frontal  of the\nlateral ventricle.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.\n2. No evidence of hydrocephalus.\n.\nCXR ()- The lungs remain clear of focal consolidation and\nthe lateral costophrenic sulci are sharply marginated.  The\nright CVL has been removed and there is no PTX.  A Dobbhoff\ncatheter is seen with the tip just below the left hemidiaphragm\nhigh in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.\n.\nCT head ()- New hemorrhage along the catheter tract,\nextending into the left frontal  of the lateral ventricle.\nOtherwise, no significant interval change.  No evidence of\nhydrocephalus.  Findings discussed with Dr.  on the same\nday.\n.\nMRI/A brain ()- The previously described intraparenchymal\nhematoma on the MR   has enlarged.  However,\ncompared to the head CT of , there has been no\nchange. There is mild associated mass effect without evidence of\nherniation. Since the head CT of , there has been\ndevelopment of a moderate-to-large left subgaleal hematoma.\n.\nCT head ()- Large right parenchymal hemorrhage with blood\ndissecting into the ventricles, with associated hydrocephalus.",
