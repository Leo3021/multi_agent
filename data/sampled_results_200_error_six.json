        "Brief Hospital Course": "48 F with ID-T2DM, Trisomy 21, OSA, presents with hypotension\nand hyperglycemia, found in septic shock.\n.\n#. Septic Shock/Fevers: Prior to presentation patient had\nsymptoms of gastroenteritis.  On presentation to the ED, her VS:\n97.8 63 108/78 22 95%.  She was found to have a Lactate 6.0,\nGluc 500. Fluid resuscitation was attempted with over 6L of\ncrystalloid (4LNS, 2L LR total). A right IJ cordis was placed.\nPressors were begun with Levo and then neosynephrine, however\nsbp remained in the 70's. She was intubated for agitation during\na-line placement. Zosyn and vancomycin were started and urine\nand blood cultures were sent, though it was unclear whether it\nwas before the abx. CXR revealed mild pulmonary congestion\nthough no obvious infiltrate. Repeat Lactate after volume\nresucitation was 3. Vital signs at the time of transfer were HR\n104, BP94/43, 100% on 100%. In the ICU her antibiotics were\nbroadened to include atypical pneumonia.  She was resusitated\nwith 9 liters of fluid her first hospital day. She continued to\nrequire levophed to maintain MAP>60. On  patient was\nbriefly started 50 mg IV hydrocort, while awaiting AM Cortisol\nand stim test, which revealed normal adrenal function. Vigeleo\nhemodynamic monitoring was placed and patient had no evidence of\ncardiogenic failure, with excellent cardiac output. CV02 sat was\n86% further ruling out cardiogenic failure and confirming likely\nsepsis and distributive shock. Evaluation for sources of\ninfection continued though proved unfruitful. Patient was ruled\nout for influenza. CT of the abdomen and pelvis were performed\nto further evaluate for source of infection and fat stranding\nabout the pancreas and part of duodenum was found which could\nsuggest pancreatitis or duodenitis. RUQ ultrasound was without\nevidence of hepatic abscess or cholecystitis. Given findings of\nduodentitis Cipro and Flagyl were started. Blood cultures,\nurine, sputum cultures were negative, though later  urine a\nsputum cultures revealed colonization with . On patient started on a trial of vasopressin in an attempt to wean\nfrom levophed. Patient continued to intermittently wean from\npressors and it was felt that much of her pressor requirement\nwas dependent on sedation. On  was briefly off of pressors.\nOn  Vancomycin and Zosyn were DC'd and PICC line placed.\nLater that day patient became febrile and B-Glucan and\nGalactomannan were sent and she was started Aztreonam,\nMicafungin and vancomycin. Cipro/flagyl were continued. On Abx pared down and Aztreonam was DC'd leaving flagyl, cipro,\nvanc, micafungin. On  Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl\nwere stopped, though later that day the patient spike to 101.3\nand became tachycardic and hypotensive, intermittently requiring\nlevophed. Random cortisol was rechecked and low compared to\nadmission at 8.7. Steroids were not started given improvement in\nblood pressure. At that time Vancomycin, Cefepime,\nCiprofloxacin, flagyl were restarted. To further evaluate for\nsource of fever LENI's were performed and negative. RUQ\nultrasound repeated and again was without evidence of hepatic\nabscess or cholecystitis. On  antibiotics were stopped\ngiven no source of infection.\n.\n#. Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated during ED course\ngiven altered mental status in the setting of hypotension.\nDuring her early ICU course the patient was supported with\nAssist Control given her NSTEMI and pressor requirement. These\nwere felt to be contraindications to extubation. As her sepsis\nresolved the patient the patients urine output dropped off and\nbecame 27 liters positive with evidence of pulmonary edema on\nchest xray. As noted below patient was aggressively diuresed\nwith IV lasix then eventually CVVH with improvement in\nrespiratory status and reassuring RSBIs and SBT. On patient was eventually extubated, intially did well, joking with\nfamily, then developed stridor, and was re-intubated. The cause\nof her stridor was felt to be multifactorial as anesthesia\nthought that she had an arytenoid dislocation (from traumatic\nintubation) and edematous upper airway. Diuresis was continued\nand the possibility of another trial of extubation was\nconsidered though it was felt this would be high risk given the\npatient's difficult intubations previously. On  thoracic\nsurgery placed perc trach. Patient quickly weaned to trach mask\nand was eventually transferred to the floor. On the floor, the\ntracheostomy was reduced in size and a PMV was placed. The\npatient was saturating 100% on room air via the tracheostomy\ncollar at the time of discharge.\n.\n#. Arytenoid Dislocation: ENT came by an evaluated the patient.\nThere was terrific edema; it was also too difficult to see the\nsubglottic area. the epiglottis was plump. Additionally, there\nwas a gap in her vocal cords. Essentially, nothing was found\nthat could explain airway difficulties; the vocal cord gap can\nbe addressed as an outpatient endoscopically. and additional\nhistory implies that some degree of her difficulties talking\nwere present before the hospitalization. Finally, ENT\nreccommended a PPI to protect the cords from acid. She has ENT\nfollowup at 2 weeks post discharge.\n.\n#. Acute Kidney Injury: Patient presented in acute kidney injury\nwith creatinine of 2.6. Through her stay in the ICU her\ncreatinine worsened to 7.1 on  before she was started on\nCVVH. Nephrology was consulted and felt that  was secondary\nto ATN in the setting of sepsis. Urine sediment revealed muddy\nbrown cast. Renal ultrasound was without obstruction. Prior to\nstarting CVVH patient was trialed on lasix gtt and intially put\nout well though was not able to keep up with her daily intake.\nPrior to transfer to the floor the patient was off CVVH for\nseveral days and continued to make excellent urine with\nstabilization in her creatinine.  Upon discharge, her Creatinine\nwas 2.0 and down-trending. She may establish a new baseline\n(higher than her baseline of 0.9 prior to admission). She has\nPCP  to recheck her Chem-7 and restart her lisinopril\nif her kidneys will tolerate it.\n.\n#. T2DM with DKA vs. HONK: Uncertain DKA vs. HONK. Interestingly\nacetone negative on admission. Insulin gtt was initiated and\npatient was supported with IVF, lab monitored every 4 hours with\nresolution of anion gap.  was consulted and helped manage\nglucose control. Her insulin regimen was uptitrated (see\nattached insulin flowchart). Upon discharge, she was getting\nlantus 25 units with breakfast in addition to an humalog insulin\nsliding scale qac/hs.\n.\n#. Hypothyroidism: 125 mcg of levothyroxine was continued. TSH\nwas measured during ICU course and revealed likely sick\neuthyroid with TSH of 15.\n.\n#. Dyslipidemia: Patient was continued on home simvastatin.\n.\n#. NSTEMI versus Demand Ischemia: On day one of hospitalization\nEKG was repeated with concerning depressions anterolaterally\nwhich were new, however no documentation of EKG in emergency\ndepartment was found. Cardiac enzymes were measured and\nelevated, enzymes peaked with CK: 3000, CKMB: 200, TroponinT: 8.\nCardiology was consulted. Patient was given full dose aspirin,\nstatin, and heparin gtt. Heparin was continued for 72 hours.\nCardiac enzymes trended down. Of note, she was not started on a\nbeta-blocker because of her labile blood pressure. A\nbeta-blocker will need to be started as an outpatient by\ncardiology or her PCP (she has followup for both). An ACEI can\nbe considered after her renal failure resolves and based on her\nnew baseline creatinine.\n.\n#. Rash: Macular rash diffuse and blanching across the abdomen.\nDerm consulted and confirmed concerns for drug rash. Sarna was\napplied to abdomen and Zosyn was stopped as this is the most\nlikely culprit. Rash improved slowly over the following days.\n.\n#. Nutrition: Patient was supported with tube feeds during her\nICU course. Nutrition recs: nutren pulmonary at 30mg/hr with 21\ngrams of benprotein.\n.\n#:Left UE swelling: US without DVT.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mr.  is a 55 yo M with PMH of Insulin Dependent Diabetes\nMellitus, Hypertension, history of CVA (per patient), who was\nfound down at group home with fingerstick of 20. In the ED\ncontinued to drop sugars inspite of D50 so was started on D5\ndrip and admitted to intensive care unit for frequent\nmonitoring.\n\n# Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 and Hypoglycemia:\nPatient remained on D5W drip overnight in the intensive care\nunit with fasting sugars rising from 140s to 200s by the morning\nand improvement of mental status. In the morning, the patient\nwas started on a diabetic diet with subcutaneous insulin sliding\nscale   diabetes consulting team's recommendations. His\nfingersticks continued to rise to 300s.  He was started on a\nbasal  dose of 25u at bedtime, decreased from dose of\n38u which he was taking at home each morning.  Mr.  was\ntransferred to the floor for further management.  On the floor,\nthe patient's blood sugars remained elevated to the 200s-400s,\nand his  dose was increased slowly to 35u at bedtime\nwith Humalog sliding scale before meals and at bedtime.  The\npatient continued to have somewhat elevated blood sugars in the\n200s with this regimen, highest sugars being at night and lowest\nsugars (170-190) before breakfast.\n\nHe was discharged on this regimen because it was felt that he\nwill be safer with higher blood sugars than lower blood sugars.\nThe long-term blood risks of high blood sugars and the need to\nfollow a good diabetic diet were explained to the patient, but\nhis insight into the subject appears to be at least somewhat\nlimited; he has had much diabetic education in the past and\ncontinues to have difficulty with diet compliance.  He does\nadminister his own insulin at the group home, but the\nadministration is monitored by staff.  There did not appear to\nbe any medical conditions causing the frequent hypoglycemia.\n\nThe discharge insulin regimen includes  35units at\nbedtime in addition to a Novolog sliding scale as attached\nbefore each meal and at bedtime. The patient should be\nsupervised with insulin administration.\n\nPatient was noted to have polyuria and polydipsia during this\nhospitalization which are apparently chronic symptoms for him;\nhe explains that he has had these symptoms for years.  He was\ngiven intravenous fluids in the setting of hyperglycemia and\nintravascular volume depletion.  It appears that he must have\nvery frequent hyperglycemia at home.\n\nHe appears to frequently get both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia\nat home, but the primary medical team during this\nhospitalization felt that the hypoglycemic episodes were more\nconcerning at this time because of their immediate danger.  The\npatient would benefit from further diabetic education.\n\n# Altered Mental Status:\nPatient presented with altered mental status of slurred speech\nand significantly decreased responsiveness.  He does have\nbaseline psychiatric disorder, remote seizure history and\npossible borderline mental retardation.  His toxicology screen\nwas negative on admission.  His altered mental status was felt\nto be secondary to hypoglycemia, as it normalized with the\nnormalization of blood sugars and administration of intravenous\nthiamine.  It was felt by the medical ICU team that he may have\ntemporarily developed thiamine deficiency in the setting of\nglucose-loading on presentation.  He was continued on oral\nthiamine supplements just during the hospitalization. By the\nmorning after admission, the patient was felt to be back at\nbaseline, Alert and Oriented x3, although tangential.\nPsychiatric medications had been held initially and restarted\nthe morning after admission after improvement in mental status.\n\n\n# History of Seizure Disorder\nPatient has remote history of seizure disorder.  Per his primary\ncare physician,  has not had a seizure in many years.  He is\ntaking phenytoin and was noted to have a low level of 4.7 on\nadmission.  Given subtherapeutic phenytoin level, he was given\nan extra one-time loading dose of phenytoin 7mg/kg (70kg),\n500mg, then restarted on his home dosing. His level may be\nre-checked at his followup primary care appointment next week.\nHe was also restarted on his valproic acid the morning after\nadmission.\n\n# Anemia\nPer iron studies, patient may have anemia of chronic disease\nbecause TIBC is low, though ferritin is also on low normal side\nat 58. RBCs are normocytic. Hematocrit remained stable, and\npatient showed no signs of bleeding.\n\n# Bipolar Mood Disorder\nPatient appeared stable during this hospitalization.  He was\ncontinued on valproic acid, risperidone, lorazepam at bedtime,\nand quetiapine on the floor.\n\n# Hypertension\nPatient's lisinopril and propranolol were initially held,\nresulting in elevated blood pressures; his blood pressures were\nbetter controlled after restarting these medications.\n\n# Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\nPatient was continued on his proton pump inhibitor.\n\n# Communication:\nPatient and group home -   in , MA\nSister  is   .\n  (another Guardian, deals w Psych Meds)\n(\n# FULL CODE",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "HOSPITAL COURSE:\n88 year old male with h/o CVA with severe aphasia with R-sided\nweakness, transferred to MICU with hypotension, treated for\nurosepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics.\n\n#. Urosepsis / Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension\nwith SBP 70s, in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and\nwith UA suggestive of UTI.  There were no other focal signs of\ninfection.  Patient was started on vanco/cefepime for broad\ncoverage given history of recurrent UTIs.  Patient had a CVL\nplaced and received aggressive fluid resuscitation (about 5L).\nHe was started on pulse dose steroids with hydrocortisone; home\nmetoprolol and lasix were held.  SBP rose to the 90-110s.\nSteroids were eventually returned to pre-admission taper.  As\nurosepsis resolved and rate control was obtained, hypotension\nresolved.  He did not require pressor support.  His urine\nculture grew Proteus sensitive to all cephalosporins and his\nantibiotics were changed to cefpodoxime for a total 10 day\ncourse.\n\n#. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  He was started on digoxin for\nrate control for atrial fibrillation given hypotension.  His\nrate responded well.  His blood pressure remained very sensitive\nto beta blockade, and his metoprolol was not restarted.  If he\ncontinues to have tachycardia, could restart slowly after\ndischarge.  His HR at discharge was 80-110.  Digoxin level was\ncheckced and was 1.7 on the day of discharge.\n\n#. Acute on chronic renal failure: He was admitted with Cr 2.5\nfrom baseline creatinine of 1.5 which was felt to be pre-renal\nin etiology in the setting of urosepsis.  Creatinine improved\nwith IV fluid resuscitation.  Lasix was held initially on\nadmission.  Once  resolved and patient fully fluid\nresuscitated, home lasix resumed.\n\n#. Hyperkalemia: Patient had K 7.5 on presentation without EKG\nchanges.  He was treated with calcium gluconate, insulin and\ndextrose, and kayexalate (once able to take PO).  Etiology\nthought to be  renal failure and baseline potassium\nsupplementation.  Once urinary output improved, potassium\nreturned to  value.\n\n#. Diabetes mellitus: Continued insulin sliding scale while in\nhouse.  His long-acting NPH was held as he did not initially\nhave oral intake.  His blood sugars ranged 80-250 while in the\nhospital, although started to trend up to high 100's by the time\nof discharge.  His NPH will likely need to be restarted slowly\nin the next 1-2 days.\n\n#. Hyperlipidemia: Statin resumed once patient stabilized on\nadmission.\n\n#. RLE swelling: He had LENIs negative for DVT.  It was felt\nthat he likely has chronic venous insufficiency.\n\n#. Other meds.  His other medications were held initially in the\nsetting of lethargy including allopurinol, ASA, citalopram,\ncranberry, Os-Cal, omeprazole, tylenol, benadryl, dulcolax,\nimodium milk of magnesia, robitussin, vicodin.  These can be\nrestarted after discharge.  His home prednisone taper and\nsimvastatin have already been restarted.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "This is an 80 yo F with h/o paranoid schizophrenia, anoxic brain\ninjury, and advanced dementia with recent aspiration event\npresented from her nursing home with acute shortness of breath\nand hypoxia.  She was admitted to the ICU.\n\n#. Hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was intubated on .\n Her respiratory failure was likely  aspiration pneumonitis\nand complicated by HAP and pulmonary edema with systolic CHF\n(LVEF 20-25%) from IVF resucitation.  Her sputum grew out staph\naureus and 2 strains of E. coli (see labs for details), so she\nwas treated with antibiotics clindamycin and aztreonam for a\ntotal of 8 days completed on  (D1 ).  She was\nactively diuresed toward the end of her ICU stay and CXR showed\nimprovement of her effusion.  She was successfully extubated on\n after discussion with family regarding goals of care\nand status of no reintubation.  PT WAS MADE  by her nephew.\nSHE IS NOT TO BE REHOSPITALIZED.  DNR/DNI\n\n#. Sepsis, likely  pneumonia and bacteremia.  Patient\ninitially had hypotention requiring pressors that was thought to\nbe  sedation for intubation, but also had acute respiratory\nfailure, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.  There\nwas concern of possible teeth abscess, but CT head was not able\nto capture and Panorex X ray was not possible given intubated\nstatus.  She has 2 sources of infection- HAP with MSSA and 2\nstrains of E. coli and coag negative staph aureus bacteremia.\nRIJ CVL was placed and PICC (placed prior to admission  at\nShirrel House) line was removed.  A-line was placed for\nmonitoring initially, but waveforms were suboptimal despite\nattempts to replace it, so ultimately, it was discontinued as\npatient was weaned off pressor.  These infections were treated\nwith clindamycin, aztreonam, and vancomycin with 8 day course\nfor HAP and further treatment for her bacteremia was held given\nthat she was made .\n\n#. Bacteremia, likely  to PICC line infection (placed on\n for treatment of recent aspiration pneumonia).  Blood cx\nshowed coag negative staph as well as enterococcus faecalis,\nsuggesting PICC line infection although PICC tip was cultured\nnegative.  She received antibiotics vancomycin to treat for the\nbacteremia as both bacteriae were susceptible, starting on\n.  The initial plan was to treat for 14 days.  However,\nantibiotics were discontinued after lengthy discussion with\nfamily/HCP who wanted to direct her care to comfort measure on\n.\n\n#. Pneumonia, likely HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia.  Patient has\nknown history of aspiratioy and was recently treated for\naspiration pneumonia prior to this admission.  Sputum grew out\nE. Coli and coag + staph aureus.  Antibiotics clindamycin and\naztreonam were chosen based on sensitivity and she was treated\nfor a total of 8 day course for HAP (D1, ) and\ncompleted on .  Repeat CXR showed improvement of the\nbibasilar opacification, which could also be atelectasis.\n\n#. Cardiac ischemia, likely from demand with active diuresis and\nrecent sepsis.  This was noted on  when telemetry\nmonitoring revealed new T-wave inversion with troponin up to\n0.14.  A discussion was held with patient's HCP regarding\ntherapy for the demand ischemia, and a decision was made to hold\noff further monitoring and intervention given her significant\ncomorbidities and that the risk likely outweighs the benefit of\nanticoagulation.\n\n#. Anemia.  Likely  anemia of chronic inflammation and\nsepsis.  She was on stress ulcer prophylaxis, and there is no\nsigns of GI bleeding.  She received a total of 2 units of pRBC\nafter discussion with her HCP, and her Hct responded\nappropriately.\n\n#. Rash.  Diffuse pustular papular rash was noted on her back.\nShe was started on clotrimazole cream for likely fungal\ninfection.\n\n#. Schizophrenia/advanced dementia.  She continued with home\ncogentin, divalproex, and megace.  Trazodone was discontinued\ngiven her initial presentation.  Toward the end of ICU stay, her\nmental status was at baseline as compared to baseline per\nreport, which is awake, oriented x1, non-verbal, and bed-bound.\n\n\n#. Teeth abscess.  This was initially reported by nephew upon\nadmission.  However, CT scan was unable to characterize the\nabscess due to resolution and location of the abscess.  Given\nthat she was intubated, Panorex was unable to be performed.  No\ndefinitive therapy was performed, but the antibiotics that she\nreceived for her infection could be helpful in treating her\nabscess as well.\n\n# Anisorcia.  This was noted during admission.  She had\nasymmetric pupils R > L and less responsive.  It was unclear of\nthe chronicity and there was no known use of eye drops,\nbreathing therapy, pupil dilation, head trauma, or\nanticoagulation.  CT head did not show herniation or acute\nbleeding.\n\n#. Nutrition.  While patient was intubated, she was on tube\nfeeding based on nutrition recommendation.  After extubation,\npatient was started on pureed diet with thickend fluid for risk\nof aspiration as for comfort per family request.  It was noted\nthat patient continued to have signs of aspiration.\n\n#. Goals of Care.  Multiple discussions were carried out with\npatient's HCP (nephew)    and  is\nalternate contact ( wife)  throughout\npatient's ICU stay.  ICU consent form was kept up to date\nthroughout her ICU stay.  Patient was made comfort measure only\non  after the event with cardiac demand ischemia.  She\nwas successfully extubated on .  All therapeutic\nmedications were discontinued. PT was made  and is not to be\nrehospitalized, DNR/DNI.\n\n#. Comfort Measure Only.  This was started after discussion with\nfamily on .  She continued with Tylenol 650 mg q6h prn\nfor pain/fever, bisacodyl 10 mg daily prn, Miralax daily prn,\ndocusate 100 mg  prn, and clotrimazole for the rash on her\nback.  She was started on lorazepam 0.5-2mg IV q1h prn for\nagitation/anxiety and morphine 2-4 mg IV q1h for pain/SOB.  She\nwas also restarted on a puree diet with thickened fluid for\ncomfort with family/HCP aware of her aspiration risk.\n\n# Prophylaxis.  Subcutaneous heparin and pantoprazole 40 mg IV\ndaily throughout most part of her ICU staty until she was made\n on .\n\n# Communication:  (HCP) and  (HCP's wife).  nurse manager at  House  .",

Intubated for airway protection\ninitially and admitted to MICU, then extubated, stablized, and\ntranferred to floor for further care.\n.\n# Alcohol withdrawal: Serum ethanol over 300 on presentation.\nDenies h/o alcohol withdrawal, seizures, and DTs, but records notable for h/o seizure disorder NOS possible related to\nEtOH given the overwhelming number of visits to this hospital\nfor EtOH intoxication. Continued folate, thiamine, MVI. Received\nsignificant valium in MICU, then tapered off on floor. CIWA\nscales <10 x 48 hours and discontinued. The patient was\nintermittently agitated on the floor demanding to leave\nrequiring code , haldol prn, and 1:1 sitter. Psych was\nconsulted and deemed him not competent to care for self (see\ndispo below).\n.\n# C-spine fracture: s/p fall from sitting while intoxicated.\nOsteophyte fracture discovered at C3/4 level. Also with\nligamentous injury but no obvious tear. Neurosurgery consulted\nand recommended Aspen C-collar at all times x 6 weeks and follow\nup with Dr.  in 6 weeks for evaluation and repeat CT\nc-spine (call  for appointment) Neurosurgery will\ncontact the pt. at the pine street shelter to schedule an\nappointment. The patient continually attempted to remove\nC-collar and required constant redirection as he did not recall\nthat he had a cervical fracture (see memory loss below).\nPsychiatry consultation obtained to determine capacity for\nrefusing collar. It was determined he lacked capacity for this\ndecision. Initially the decision was that we would proceed to\nguardianship, but given that there is no practical way to force\nhim to wear the collar even with guardianship short of 4-point\nrestraints and sedation for 6 weeks, we consulted legal\nservices. There was consensus that although this is an unstable\nlesion, that there is nothing to do to force him to wear it, and\nthat we would send him to a shelter with the collar and\nreiteration to the patient as well as contacting the shelter\nstaff about wearing the collar.\n.\n#cervical collar: We strongly stressed to Mr.  that he must\nwear the cervical collar for 6 weeks at all times. We have\nexplained to him the seriousness of his injury and the fact that\nhe could suffer from serious spinal cord injury if he does not\nwear the collar, the patient was agreable to wearing the collar\non discharge.\n.\n# Nasal fractures, left orbital floor fracture: Plastics and ENT\nconsulted in MICU. s/p closed reduction of nasal fracture and\nnasal packing (Dr. . Unclear initially if orbital\nfracture new or old (if old then deemed non-operative), but\nafter limited movement noted on reduction, plastics team\nbelieved that these fracutres were likely old. Nasal packing\nremoved on . There was no evidence of eye entrapment on ENT\nevaluation. The patient received 5 days clindamycin per ENT due\nto nasal manipulation.\n.\n# Memory loss: Likely due to chronic EtOH abuse, however\ntraumatic brain injury possibly contributing. Baseline appears\nto be A&Ox2 per  records obtained, and notes signify planned\noutpatient w/u for dementia. Despite continued reminders, the\npatient did not remember that he sustained C-spine fracture.\nNeuropsych testing recommended in 6 weeks once acute issues\nresolved.\n.\n# Anemia: Microcytic. Unknown baseline HCT. Iron studies c/w\niron-deficiency and he was started on iron supplements. Hct\nremained stable in the mid-30s during hospital stay. No prior\ncolonoscopy. The patient will need further GI work-up.\n.\n# Nausea: Unclear cause. No associated abdominal pain, vomiting,\nor diarrhea. LFTs, amylase, lipase without specific\nabnormalities. Resolved spontaneously and was tolerating POs at\ndischarge.\n.\n# Peripheral neuropathy: Patient c/o pain bilat foot pain.\nNeuropathy likely EtOH-related. He was given Tylenol 500mg q6h\nand started on gabapentin 300mg tid trial with subjective\nimprovement, but pt. is still complaining of foot pain.\nTherefore, it is unclear if this is really neuropathy, we did\nnot discharge the pt. with neurontin.\n.\n# h/o seizure disorder: Per  records. Unclear etiology (?EtOH\nrelated). Never been on medications.\n.\n# Low grade fever, cough: Concern for respiratory infection,\nespecially aspiration given EtOH abuse, somnolence, recent\nintubation. Lung exam with coarse breath sounds throughout. CXR\nwithout acute process and U/A negative. Cough resolved and\nremained afebrile.\n.\n# Hypernatremia: Likely due to poor access to free water,\nresolved with hydration. Cont to monitor sodium daily.\n.\n# ?Glaucoma: Right eye, discovered on ENT eval (elevated IOP @\n35, enlarged cup-to-disc ratio). Initially on eye drops per\ntheir recs but then they recommended d/c as repeat IOP when\npatient more cooperative was normal (11). Recommended outpatient\ncomprehensive eye examination (call ).\n.\n# Dispo: Deemed incompetent to care for self by psych team. Will\nbe discharged to the Pine street shelter. He will also be\nconsidered for a bed at the  house.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "is a 78-year-old man with past medical history\nnotable for atrial fibrillation, who had been anticoagulated on\nCoumadin until approximately six days\nprior to his initial admission for colonoscopy, CHF, coronary\nartery disease status post CABG in , and a prior stroke\napproximately 10 years ago with some residual right-sided\nweakness who is currently admitted to the neurology inpatient\nstroke service.  In the setting of his Coumadin being held, he\nhad sustained a fall and had significant hemorrhagic contusions\nto his bilateral frontal and anterior temporal lobes and had\nbeen taken care of by the neurosurgical service.  During this\ntime, his Coumadin was continued to be held.  Neurology became\ninvolved\nin his care on  at which time there was some concern for a\nchange in behavior including some greater lethargy.  An MRI\nshowed right-sided large wedge-shaped infarcts, likely\ncardioembolic in etiology.\n\nOn general physical exam the morning of , the patient is\nafebrile, but is tachycardic to the low 100s with an irregularly\nirregular rhythm.  His lungs sound clear; however, there is a\nmachine-like murmur to his heart that seems to encompass both\nthe systolic and diastolic phases of the rhythm.  He is also\nsomewhat\ntachypneic about 24 with peak respiratory rate of 30 breaths per\nminute last night.\n\nOn neurological exam, the patient can make some brief verbal\nutterances, but is largely obtunded and inattentive.  His left\neye seems somewhat skewed upward at baseline; however, he\nappears to be able to look fully both to the right and to the\nleft, with horizontal eye movements.  He was uncooperative with\nthe formal\nmotor exam, though he was able to raise all extremities against\ngravity.  Reflexes were symmetric, though he did appear to have\nan upgoing left toe.\n\nWhile on the Nsurg service he became more somnolent.  He was\nfound to have\na partial Right MCA (inferior division territory) infarction.\nThe exam findings of mild  weakness on the left and extinction\nto DSS fit with a medium-sized right parietal infarct. A clot\nwas seen in left atrial appendage on a CTA of the chest. Patient\nplaced on heparin will montitor with CT in am of  he was\ncontinued Keppra 500  for seizure prophylaxis. For the UTI he\nwas kept on the antibiotic:bactrim (UTI/ESCHERICHIA COLI - end\n).\n\nPatient was unable to swallow and required a feeding tube.\nPalliative care was consulted and goals of care were addressed.\nAfter lengthy discussions with the family the decision was made\nfor comfort measures only and no escalation of care.  He was\ntherefore made comfortable and no further work up of his\nconditions was made.",

While awaiting Plavix wash-out he was\nmedically managed. On  he was brought to the operating room\nwhere he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please\nsee operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he\nwas transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated in critical\nbut stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from\nsedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He weaned\noff pressor support and Beta-blocker/aspirin/statin and diuresis\nwere initiated. He was transfused with blood products\npostoperatively for coagulopathy and anemia likely due to blood\nloss and volume resucitation. POD#1 A right pneumothorax was\nevident on CXR. A thoracosotomy tube was inserted and remained\nin until pneumothorax resolved. All tubes and drains were\ndiscontinued per protocol. Anticoagulation was resumed for his\nchronic atrial fibrillation. He remained in CVICU until POD#3\nfor aggressive pulmonary hygiene. He was slow to progress but\ntransferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.\nPhysical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and\nmobility.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I,\nhypothyroidism, gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic\nrespiratory failure.\n.\n1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure: She arrived intubated and sedated\nfrom  Hospital.  On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar\nand bibasilar opacities, which appeared conistent with pulmonary\nedema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia.  There was\nno evidence of ARDS.  She was known to have gram-positive cocci\nin her sputum at the outside hospital.  A bronchoscopy with BAL\nwas performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA.  She\nwas treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia.\n.\n   A CT scan was performed on  to evaluate the soft tissue\nswelling seen on CT at the outside hospital.  The CT showed\nincreased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be\nsecondary to prolonged intubation/trauma.  She was treated with\nsteroids for this swelling at the outside hospital, and these\nwere continued.  It was decided that patient should receive one\nmore trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy.\nShe did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to\ndelay extubating the patient until the morning of .\nOvernight, the patient became hypoxic, dropping to the 80's.  A\nchest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high\nin the trachea.  The cuff was deflated and the patient was\nextubated.  She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask\nand her sats immediately improved.  She was weaned down until\nshe was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by\nnasal cannuala.  As she was doing well without evidence of\nstridor, the steroids were stopped.  She did well and was weaned\nfrom supplemental oxygen.  At the time of discharge, she was\noxygenating well on room air.  She Will need to complete a 14\nday course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on .\n.\n2. Enterobacter bacteremia: She was initially covered broadly\nwith vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and falgyl.  She had positive\nblood cultures at  Hospital for gram negative rods.\nSubsequently, zosyn was added.  The cultures grew out\nenterobacter cloacae.  It was unclear the source of her\nbacteremia.  Her stool cultures were negative.  Her central line\nwas removed and the tip was culture negative.  She was\ntransitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia.  She had no\npositive cultures during this admission.  Once she was more\nstable, an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess.\nThis study was negative.  However, the study was limited due to\ninadequate po contrast intake by the patient; it did show a\nquestion of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel.\nThis study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po's.\n She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her\nbacteremia on .\n.\n3. Diabetes type I: She was intially maintained on an insulin\ndrip for tight glycemic control.  She was followed by during the admission.  She was initially maintained on D5W,\nwhich was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently\nborderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip.   Once she began\nto take PO's, the insulin drip was stopped and patient was\nstarted on glargine with a humalog sliding scale.  While her po\nintake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV\ndextrose to suppress ketosis.  While she was on the IV dextrose,\nshe required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control.\nAs she starting taking some foods, her glargine was decrease.\nAt the time of discharge her glargine was 10.  Her blood glucose\nwere under good control.  The day prior to discharge, she was\nnauseated and not taking pos.  Therefore, she received 1L of D5,\nand her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge.\n.\n4. Gastroparesis: She has a history of gastroparesis secondary\nto long-standing type I diabetes.  Once she was extubated, she\nwas nauseated with emesis.  She was intially treated with\nerythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to\nreglan in the past.  She continued to remained nauseated so she\nwas treated with phenergan, anzemet, zofran, and ativan.  She\nintermittently was able tolerate pos.  Her nausea was\naccompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with\nmorphine.  She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain\ncontrol.  She continued to have nausea despite an agressive\nanti-emetic regimen.  It was felt that her symptoms were\nsecondary to gastroparesis.  However, other causes were looked\nfor including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction.  She\nhad a normal cortisol stimulation test.  A abdominal plain film\nshowed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an\nearly obstruction.  A NG tube was placed for decompression given\nthe signs of early obstruction the day of transfer.  The GI\nservice was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all\ngastroparesis.  They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm.  She\nshould eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out\nceliac disease.\n.\n5. Transaminitis: Per report, She had elevated LFTs at the\noutside hospital.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was\nperformed and was negative for any acute pathology.  Her LFTs\ntrended down during this admission.\n.\n6. Hypothyroidism: She was maintained on her levothyroxine.\nWhile she was not taking adequate pos, she was on IV\nlevothyroxine.\n.\n7. F/E/N: She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings\nfor nutrition. After extubation, patient was started on sips and\nhad a speech and swallow evaluation.  She was cleared to advance\nher diet as tolerated.  She only tolerated some clear liquids.\nAt the time of transfer, she was NPO given her NG tube.\n.\n8. Prophylaxis: PPI, Heparin SQ.\n.\n9. Access: Her central line was removed given the concern for a\nline infection.  She had a double lumen PICC place.\n.\n10. CODE: FULL\n.\n11.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "67 year old male with s/p posterolateral STEMI causing VF arrest\nand MVA, now s/p BMS to OM1 on  with improving altered\nmental status.\n\n#VF arrest after OM1 occlusion:  Patient with no history of\ncardiac disease s/p VF arrest in the field resulting in\nintubation and transfer.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with\nRBBB, ST elevation in I and avF with ST depressions in V1-V3,\nconsistent with postero-lateral infarct. Atrial fibrillation\nself converted to a sinus rhythm.  Troponin peaked at 10.84. CK\npeaked at 5707 and CKMB peaked at 442.  The patient started on\nArctic Sun cooling protocol and rewarmed. Patient had cardiac\ncatheterization given EKG changes and an OM1 lesion was stented\nwith a bare metal stent (please see Cath results above).\nInitially, the patient received fluids for blood pressure\nsupport when blood pressure resolved, he was diuresised with\nlasix drip. In the setting of hypotension the patient developed\nshock liver that resolved in three days.  The patient was\nsuccessfully extubated on .\n-Continue Plavix 75 mg daily\n-Continue ASA 325 mg daily\n-Continue metoprolol succinate 100 mg q day\n-Continue lisinopril 5 mg q day\n\n# Altered mental status: After rewarming from the cooling\nprotocol, the patient was acutely agitated and disoriented.  He\nrequired IV Haldol for agitation.  Since that time, he has been\ncalm, but still confused.  He initially made inappropriate\nstatements, with tangential and circumferential thinking.\nCurrently, he is alert and oriented to place, time, and person,\nalthough he remains confused about the time line of his heart\nattack.  He had an Head MRI revealing no acute intracranial\nabnormalities and will be follow by Neurology as an outpatient.\n\n.\n# Aspiration Acquired PNA:  The patient was febrile prior to and\nafter extubation.  It was believed that he had an aspiration\nevent prior to being intubated and during his PMA arrest.  His\nBC were negative, and his sputum culture grew out Methicillin\nsensitive S. Aureus.  He had been placed on cefepime,\nvancomycin, and metronidazole for empiric coverage.  However, he\ndeveloped a maculopapular rash that was believed to be secondary\nto cefepime.  After his sputum culture grew out MSSA he was\nplaced on linezolid.\n- Continue Linezolid for aspiration PNA until .\n.\n# Urinary retention: Foley was d/c??????d on  and did not urinate\nfor 10 hours.  Bladder scan revealed 460 cc after attempted\nurination.  A straight catheter was attempted and failed to\nevacuate more urine.  Patient was able to urinate another 200 cc\nand patient refusing foley catheter.  After being transferred to\nthe floor the patient had 2 PVR showing 400 cc of urine in the\nbladder.  At that time he had mild suprapubic discomfort.  His\nurinary retention was thought to be secondary to decreased\ncontraction after being cooled.  He will need to be straight\ncathed, and he will need to receive tamsulosin.\n- Daily in/out catheterization for urinary retention\n- Daily post void residuals\n- Tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily\n.\n# MVA: Sternal pain upon deep inspiration.   be secondary to\nair bag deployment.  Upon arrival to the hospital his initial\ntrauma evaluation did not reveal any abnormalities.\n.\n# Afib s/p vfib arrest self-converted into SR: Resolved. Chads\nscore is Zero.\n.\n# Acute Renal failure:  While cooled his blood pressure and\nurine output were poor.  He required IVF for blood pressure\nsupport.  He then required diuresis, and creatinine peaked at\n1.3 but slowly trended down.  During diuresis his FeNa was less\nthan 1%.  His discharge creatinine was 1.0.\n.\n# Elevated LFTs: His LFTs were elevated, but trended down.  This\nwas likely due to shock liver in the setting of v.fib arrest.\n.\n# Hypothyroid: Throughout his hospital course his Levothyroxine\nwas continued at 50mcg daily.\n.\n# Loose Stool: 3 loose bowel movements prior to discharge.\nStarted on Loperamide.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "Mrs.  was involved in a high speed rollover down a 15 ft.\nembankment.  She was the unrestrained driver.  Extrication was\nprolonged but she was eventually taken to  Hospital. Due\nto multiple injuries including C spine she was transferred to\n for further evaluation.  She was seen in the Emergency\nRoom, outside scans were reviewed and her vital signs remained\nstable.  She was admitted to the Trauma ICU for management.\n\nHer airway was monitored closely as she had a prevertebral\nhematoma presumed secondary to her multiple cervical fractures.\nThis proved to be  problem, her oxygen saturations were stable\nand she was able to cough up her secretions.  Her hematocrit was\nalso followed and she was transfused with 2 units of packed red\nblood cells for a hematocrit of 21.  Subsequently she maintained\na hematocrit in the 25-26 range.  Her neurologic status remained\nintact.  There was no evidence of any decreased sensation or\nparesthesias in her extremities.\n\nDuring her ICU stay the Vascular and Neurosurgery services were\nconsulted as her CTA of the neck was concerning for a right\nvertebral dissection vs. atherosclerotic changes.  She was\nbriefly placed on heparin however at discharge she will be\nplaced on aspirin and Plavix and will have a repeat CTA of the\nneck in 2 weeks.  At that time further recommendations for\nanticoagulation will be given. She was asymptomatic from that\nstandpoint.\n\nHer blood sugars were out of control on admission requiring an\ninsulin drip for the first 3 days however she was transitioned\nto part of her pre admission Levemir dose and this has gradually\nbeen adjusted to attempt to keep her sugars between 60 and 120.\n\nDue to her multiple issues a PICC line was placed for\nmedications and phlebotomy however this may be for the short\nterm.  Her diet was advanced to a diabetic diet and she was able\nto eat without any difficulty.  Her foley catheter is scheduled\nto be removed at midnight tonight.\n\nFollowing transfer to the Trauma floor she was evaluated by\nPhysical Therapy and Occupational Therapy as she was quite\nlimited in her ability to move with her multiple fractures and\northotics.  She will require acute rehabilitation with the hopes\nof maintaining her independence at home.",

There is a fracture involving the C7 right\ntransverse process best seen on series 4 image 73 involving the\ntransverse foramina. There is also a fracture involving the C1\nright transverse process best seen on series 4 image 24 as well\nas series 9 image 53 which does not clearly extend to the\ntransverse foramina. Irregularity at the superior endplate of C7\nis likely related to motion artifact. However, given the lucent\nline seen on series 4 image 71 involving the superior endplate\nof C7 a fracture cannot be entirely\nexcluded.\nBilateral rib fractures involving the posterior arch of the\nfirst ribs is\nseen. The left posterior second rib is also fractured. On the\nlateral view\nthere is maintenance of cervical alignment. Small amount of\ndegenerative\ndisease is noted in the mid cervical spine with loss of disc\nspace and small spurring. A posterior disc-osteophyte complex is\nseen at C4-5 and C5-6.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue\nswelling.  IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures involving the cervical\nspine as detailed above\nwith involvement of the transverse process and several fractures\ninvolving the transverse foramina. Correlate with CTA to assess\nfor associated vertebral artery injury. No malalignment or\nevidence of unstable fracture. An MRI spine to further assess as\nclinically warranted.\n\n CTA Head and Neck :\n  Segmental non-visualization of the right vertebral artery\npredominantly more proximally. This is likely more due to\natherosclerotic disease than\ntrauma/dissection , but further evaluation can be obtained with\ngadolinium- enhanced MRA and fat- suppressed axial images of the\nneck if clinically\nindicated. Otherwise, no vascular occlusion or stenosis seen in\nthe carotid or vertebral arteries. Intracranial CTA appears\nunremarkable except for vascular calcifications. This report is\nprovided without the availability of 3D reformatted images. When\nadditional images are available, and if there is additional\ninformation obtained, an addendum will be given to this report.\n\n MRI C Spine : 1. Large prevertebral hematoma in the\ncervical region from craniocervical junction to C5 level.\n2. Increased interspinous signal at C5-6 level indicating injury\nto the\ninterspinous ligament but no evidence of disruption of the\nanterior, posterior longitudinal ligaments of ligamentum flavum\nidentified.\n3.

Today, became agitated, hostile,\nconfused, and paranoid. Was recently treated for UTI, but UA in\nED consistent with UTI. Mental status change likely worsening chronic subdural hematoma in combination with UTI and\nknown Alzheimer's dementia. Neurosurgery followed throughout\nadmission and family and pt did consent for burr hole drainage\nof hematoma, which occurred on HD#7. Procedure was\nuncomplicated. Please see full operative note for details. She\nwas transferred to the TSICU for a short period of recovery and\nwas called out to the floor on POD#1. She was started on\ndilantin for seizure prophylaxis, but was extremely sedated on\nPOD#2. Given concern for continued bleeding versus infection, an\nextensive workup was initiated. Her head CT was unchanged, CXR\nWNL, UA not c/w UTI, and EEG without seizure activity. Neurology\nwas consulted and neurosurgery also assessed pt. Given lack of\nabnormal results, most likely culprit was determined to be\ndilantin, as level was corrected with albumin to 21\n(supratherapeutic). By POD#3, her mental status began to return\nto baseline and neurosurgery recommended d/c'ing dilantin as\nrisk of sedation outweighs risk of seizure activity. Throughout\nthe rest of her hospitalization, her mental status was at\nbaseline--alert, responsive to verbal stimuli, follows commands,\ngenerally sensical speech with evidence of dementia, lack of\norientation to time/place.\n.\n*) UTI: Initially thought to be contributing to mental status\nchange. Culture of previous UTI showed urogenital contamination,\nthough pt tx with cipro. Pt did not have additional systemic sx\nlike fever, chills, back pain. Pt was started on ceftriaxone,\ntransitioned to cefpodoxime, but antibiotics were d/c'd when\nurine culture returned as contaminated. Pt had a second UTI on\nPOD#3, which was negative.\n.\n*) Poor PO intake: Pt was seen by nutrition, who suggested\nEnsure supplementation with meals. Despite return to baseline\nmental status, pt did not take in significant POs. IV fluids\nwere continued to ensure adequate hydration and should be\ncontinued upon discharge (D5 1/2NS @ 60cc/hr) until tolerating\nadequate POs.\n.\n*) Atrial fibrillation: Pt was mostly in NSR during the\nhospitalization, with occassional episodes of coarse a fib with\nreturn to NSR. Not on anticoagulation  fall risk and SDH.\nTEDs and pneumoboots were placed for prophylaxis. No indication\nfor tele. Per neurosurgery, safe to restart ASA on POD#7. Will\ndefer to provider following pt upon discharge.\n.\n*) HTN: BPs stable without meds.\n.\n*) Gout: Continued colchicine.\n.\n*) Anemia: Continued iron.

He was transferred to the CCU after developing\nhypotension with associated mental status change after attempted\ndiuresis with IV lasix drip along with nesiritide. In order to\ntreat the hypotension, consideration must be given to his poor\nheart function which, in and of itself, likely has large\ncontribution to the hypotensive picture.  The patient was\nstarted on lasix drip with dopamine for inotropic support. His\nhemodynamic status remained tenuous and his urine output was\nonly marginally satisfactory.  The following morning the patient\nwent into atrial fibrillation and became hypotensive.\nCardioversion was not successful.  Levophed was started for\nblood pressure support, dopamine was weaned. Chemical\ncardioversion and rate control was successfully achieved with\namiodarone.  The patients hemodynamic status improved.  The\nfollowing morning, however, the patient again became hypotensive\nwith increasing oxygen requirement and declining urinary output.\n Mental status unchanged.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "The patient was admitted to the  general surgery service\non  and\nhad an open ventral hernia repair with component separation and\nmesh.  Patient tolerated procedure well but required\nneosynephrine for intraoperative hypotension.  Remained in PACU\nPOD0 to AM POD1 for hypotension/oliguria.  Admitted TSICU POD1\nfor blood pressure support, intensive hemodynamic monitoring.\n\nNeuro: Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural placed.\nPost-operatively, the epidural rate was decreased secondary to\nhypotension.  Hypothesized that epidural placement may have been\nintra-thecal given hypotension.  Epidural was capped and removed\nAM POD1 and patient started on  Dilaudid IV/PCA with good effect\nand adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the\npatient was transitioned to oral pain medications.\n\nCV: The patient was hypotensive in the operating room requiring\nneosynephrine for BP support.  This was attributed to having\ntaken AM dose ACE inhibitor and subsequently theorized to\npossibly be related to question of intrathecal placement of\nepidural catheter.  Hypotension persisted postop in PACU though\nnot accompanied by tachycardia. Patient received several boluses\nof 1L LR in PACU POD0-1 for hypotension/oliguria.  TTE POD1\ndemonstrated hyperdynamic physiology but no structure\nabnormality.  Following removal of epidural on POD1, BP improved\nand patient was weaned off pressors POD1-2 and this was\ntolerated well though with continued mild sinus tachycardia (HR\n95-105).  Home anti-hypertensives were resumed POD5-6.  Vital\nsigns were routinely monitored.\n\nPulmonary: Patient had persistent O2 requirement likely\nsecondary to baseline COPD, obesity and fluid overload given to\nsupport blood pressure.  POD1 patient received multiple doses of\nlasix to attempt diuresis and assist in pulmonary function.\nPOD2 patient was briefly started on a lasix gtt in setting of\nrespiratory distress.  CXR obtained at that time showed\npulmonary congestion and atelectasis.  Serial CXRs were\nperformed to assess pulmonary status and patient was\nintermittently diuresed to assist in fluid removal.  O2\nrequirement decreased in subsequent days and SaO2 improved with\nincreased patient activity.  Pulmonary toilet including\nincentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged.\nVital signs were routinely monitored.  At time of discharge, she\nstill had saturations in the mid-80s with exertion, and a\nbaseline of 93RA, 94 on 2L NC.  No obvious crackles or wheezing\non exam.\n\nGI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given multiple IVF\nboluses as outlined above.  Her diet was advanced to sips POD1\nand regular DM diet POD2, which was tolerated well. She was\nreturned to her normal, baseline bowel pattern which alternates\nbetween frequent, loose BMs and constipation.  She manages this\nw diet at baseline and has continued to do so. Patient was\noliguric in PACU as mentioned above requiring multiple IVF\nboluses and neosynephrine to support renal perfusion.  Patient\nwas hep locked on POD1 and did not require additional IVF\nthrougout stay.  Cr checked on POD1 showed increase from\n0.9(baseline) to 2.1.  FeNa 0.1% c/w prerenal.  Cr rose again to\n2.4 POD2 but then decreased to baseline over following days.  As\nabove lasix given on multiple occasions to support urine output\nand diurese fluid overload.  Foley was removed on POD#5 and\npatient voided appropriately. Intake and output were closely\nmonitored.\n\nID: Preoperatively, the patient was given\nvancomycin/levofloxacin and this was continued for one\nadditional postop dose. The patient's temperature was closely\nwatched for signs of infection.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible.\n\nHEME: Patient's hct was checked postop and found to be similar\nto preop value (38->34).  This remained consistent over course\nof admission with no significant change from baseline.\n\nAt the time of discharge on POD 8, the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.",

VPA level was found to\nbe 29 despite recent dose increase to 750mg TID, so most likely\nreason for her seizure was suspected missed doses of AEDs (VPA +\nKeppra) secondary to blocked PEG tube. She was loaded with IV\nVPA and Keppra in the ED. NCHCT also showed acute on chronic L\nSDH and  of L lateral ventricle, so VPS causing SDH could have been contributing. Toxic-metabolic workup\nwas otherwise negative.\n\n20-minute EEG subsequently showed multiple right-sided PLEDs and\n3 electrographic seizures, so patient was admitted to the\nEpilepsy Monitoring Unit for closer monitoring.\n\nIn the hospital, patient remained on bedside EEG for five days.\nOn EEG she initially was found to be having extremely frequent\nepileptiform discharges and electrographic seizures located over\nthe right hemisphere with few clinical correlates (except for\noccasional left facial twitching and left hand twitching):\ndiagnosis was non-convulsive status epilepticus. Accordingly,\nher anti-epileptics were aggressively uptitrated. First her\nKeppra was increased to 2000mg IV BID. Then she was started on\nstanding lorazepam. Next, she was started on trial of Lacosamide\nfor non-convulsive status. Her seizure frequency improved\ngreatly after uptitration of these meds, and her mental status\nseemed to improve slightly in that she was more responsive to\nexaminers with fewer nystagmoid eye movements on day of\ndischarge. Her discharge AED regimen is as follows: VPA 750mg\nTID (home dose), Keppra 2000mg , Lacosamide 150mg , and\nlorazepam 0.5mg TID. Plan is for her to taper the lorazepam to\noff over the next 15 days: 0.5mg TID x5 days, then 0.5mg  x5\ndays (starting ), then 0.5mg daily x5 days (starting\n), then STOP.\n\n# VP SHUNT: NCHCT in the ED revealed VPS ,  VPS\nwas reprogrammed by neurosurgery. Patient will follow up with\nneurosurgery (Dr.  in 2 weeks for repeat NCHCT\nand evaluation of VPS.\n\n# GI: On HD #2 patient's damaged PEG tube was replaced under\nflouroscopy by Interventional Radiology. After this it\nfunctioned without any further issues. She will follow up with\nIR q3 months for routine replacement of PEG tube (to be\nscheduled by IR).\n\n# ID: no active issues during hospitalization.\n\n# CV: continued home metoprolol for HTN.\n\n# CHRONIC PROBLEMS\n\n- s/p TBI: continued home Baclofen (for muscle contractures) and\nAmantadine (for arousal) + Percocet PRN pain\n- Depression: continued home sertraline\n- s/p tracheostomy: continued home albuterol + ipratropium nebs\nPRN\n- GI ppx: continue home ranitidine\n- DVT ppx: SC heparin, pneumoboots\n- Precautions: seizures and falls\n\n=================================",

A VP shunt catheter is seen overlying the left\nchest, unchanged from prior exams. The lung volumes are low.  A\nlinear opacity at the right base and mild volume loss is\nconsistent with atelectasis.  Left basilar atelectasis is also\npresent.  This is similar in appearance to the prior chest\nradiograph in .  There is no pulmonary edema,\npleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal\nsilhouette is normal.\nIMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.\n\nEEG (): At baseline, the recording showed periodic\nlateralized\nepileptiform discharges (PLEDs) especially in the right frontal\ncentral area. In addition, there were three electrographic\nseizures with very rapid, rhythmic  Hz sharp wave activity\njust posterior to the frontal sharp waves on the right side. The\nseizures lasted about a minute. On video, there was no clear or\nmajor change in behavior. There was a bit of blinking. In one,\nin the right hand quivered a bit of the left was patent by\nblankets. There was no convulsion.\nABNORMALITY #2: Background activity was of very low voltage\nbroadly over the left side.\nHYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.\nINTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.\nSLEEP: The patient appeared to be awake between seizures, but no\nnormal\nwaking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the rightsided PLEDs, especially\nfrontally,\nwith the three electrographic seizures described above, with\nminimal clinical signs.\n\nEEG (): Began just after midnight on the night of the 31st\nand continued through 9:00 the next morning. Throughout the\nrecord, it showed extremely frequent sharp wave and following\nslow wave discharges widely over the right hemisphere and\nparticularly in frontal regions, but the periodic appearance had\ndiminished. The electrographic seizures, on the other hand,\nincreased in frequency. Bursts of spikes and sharp waves were\nfrequent sometimes for just two to three seconds but often in\nlonger runs constituting electrographic seizures. These seizures\noccurred about three times an hour and were not diminishing by\nthe time of the end of the recording. They usually remained\nrestricted to the right hemisphere. On video, there was usually\nno movement evident but, on one occasion, there was turning of\nher eyes to the left.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed extremely frequent rightsided\nspikes and\nsharp waves.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same electrographic\nseizures described above.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a disorganized background\nthroughout with\nextremely frequent epileptiform discharges broadly over the\nright hemisphere. Periodic discharges were no longer evident,\nbut there were extremely frequent bursts of more rapid\nepileptiform discharges for a few seconds at a time and also\nelectrographic seizures lasting a minute or more, about three\ntimes an hour, possibly increasing toward the end of the record.\n\nEEG (): Began at 7:01 on the morning of  and\nshowed a low voltage fast pattern in all areas, likely\nreflecting medication use. There continued somewhat periodic\npolysharp wave discharges broadly over the right hemisphere,\nappearing every three seconds or so. On the first morning, the\nsharp waves progressed to rapid,  Hz sharp and spike\nactivity especially in the right temporal region, spreading more\nbroadly over the right hemisphere and becoming seizures lasting\nthree to four minutes at a time. Typically, on video, there was\nno motor phenomena. The seizures occurred about three times an\nhour in the morning. By the afternoon, seizures were occurring a\nbit more than once an hour and, after 2:00, there were three\nseizures until the end of the recording at 7:00.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same innumerable right\nhemisphere spikes and sharp waves.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same seizures described\nabove.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed continued right hemisphere\nperiodic sharp\nwave discharges throughout, often at about one every two\nseconds. There were also very frequent three to four minute long\nelectrographic seizures beginning in the same area and spreading\nthrough most of the right hemisphere but usually with no motor\nfindings on video. Over the course of the recording, seizures\ndecreased markedly in frequency.\n\nEEG ():  Began at 7:01 on the morning of  and\ncontinued until 8 the next morning. For much of the record, it\nshowed less\nfrequent blood rate hemisphere sharp waves with some following\nslowing than it had shown on earlier recordings. These sharp\nwaves did not appear\nperiodically. There were 13 electrographic seizures recorded.\nThe first was\nat 7:29 on the first morning. It began in the same area as the\nright temporal sharp waves, maximal at T4-T6, with a \"PLEDs\nplus\" onset and rapid sharp activity following the larger sharp\nwave. This rhythmic sharp activity remained restricted to the\nright temporal region for about 12 seconds, and then there was\nsharp and very irregular  Hz activity in all areas for\nabout one minute. On video, there was no clear left facial\ntwitching or other movement. Very similar seizures occurred\nlater. They were somewhat less frequent beginning on the evening\nof the 23rd. A few were associated with facial twitching.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same very frequent right\nhemisphere\ndischarges.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same seizures described\nabove.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a disorganized background\nthroughout with\nvery frequent right hemisphere sharp and slow wave discharges,\nmaximal in the right anterior to mid temporal region. These\ndischarges occurred at least every few seconds but were not\nrhythmic or periodic. The same area was associated with the\nonset of all the electrographic and clinical seizures described\nabove. Seizures lasted for a minute or so and often had no\nclinical correlate. They were far less frequent than they were a\nfew days earlier.\n\nEEG (): Began at 7:01 on the morning of  and\ncontinued\nfor 24 hours. At the onset, it showed a very low voltage\nbackground in all\nareas. Frequencies were generally faster, but there was\nwidespread slowing\nover the right hemisphere, and there were area frequent moderate\nvoltage\npolymorphic sharp waves seen broadly over the right side\nparticularly in\ncentral and temporal areas. These sharp waves were not rhythmic\nor periodic. The record also showed three electrographic\nseizures, all beginning in the same area as the sharp waves just\ndescribed. Typically, the sharp waves became more periodic, at\nabout 1 Hz, four minutes before the seizure. On video, there was\nno facial twitching or other clear motor sign of the seizure.\nThey lasted about a minute.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same very frequent right\nhemisphere\nespecially central temporal, polymorphic sharp wave discharges.\nOverall, they became less frequent over the course of the\nrecording and gave way to\nirregular slowing. There were exceptions with more rapid and\nperiodic\ndischarges for short periods.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same seizures described\nabove at other periods of more rhythmic rightsided sharp waves.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There was a single activation for\nmovement or\ntechnical reasons, likely a mistake in activation. There were\nnone for\nclinical events.\nSLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a lower voltage fast\nbackground, likely\nindicative of medication effect. There continued to be prominent\nslowing\nbroadly over the right side, and there were very frequent right\ncentral\ntemporal sharp wave discharges. These are far less rhythmic than\non earlier\nrecordings. In the same area was involved three clinical\nseizures, around\nnoon, at 7 in the evening, and just before midnight. The seizure\nfrequency\nwas markedly reduced from that on earlier days.",

        "Brief Hospital Course": "30 yo male with HTN, hypokalemia, CKDIII, h/o untreated positive\nPPD presents with few days abdominal pain that has now resolved\nwith 2-3 months weight loss, bilateral leg edema, anorexia found\nto have anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure,\nhypoalbuminemia, symmetric diffuse lymphadenopathy and volume\noverload with exam suggestive of acute diastolic heart failure.\nConcerned for neoplastic and, chronic inflammatory, or\ninfectious processes.\n.\n# Acute diastolic heart failure: He was noted to be in acute\ndiastolic heart failure on transfer from the ICU. He was given\nlasix 40 mg iv x 1, and continued on a 20 mg iv daily regimen,\nthen was transitioned to 40mg PO daily. Daily weights and I/O's\nwere followed. His blood pressure was controlled as below; in\nparticular, he was started on beta blocker, resumed on an ACEI\n(which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy), and started\non spironolactone as well. His O2 requirement was weaned off.\n.\n# Hypoalbuminemia: possibly renal or primary GI. Nothing on\nhistory to suggest primary GI protein losing enteropathy though\nthis should be considered (i.e. celiac sprue, lymphoma, IBD,\namyloid etc.) especially in light of improving renal function\nwhich argues against primary renal protein loss, low albumin,\nabsence of known liver disease and weight loss. SPEP/UPEP\nnegative. Anti-TTG IgA negative. Pt should discuss need for\ncolonoscopy with his PCP given anemia, weight loss and age.\n.\n# Gram positive bacteremia, unclear source: He was initially\nstarted on vanc, but this was d/c'd when this culture latered\nspeciated with coagulase negative staph. No subsequent cultures\nhad growth.\n.\n#non-specific enteritis-seen on CT scan. This likely explains\nreports of abdominal pain and diarrhea recently. Pt's abdominal\npain resolved. He did not have diarrhea and stool studies were\nnegative. Symptoms resolved and pt was tolerating a regular\ndiet.\n.\n# Weight Loss - 25-30lb. Large DDx. Concerning for primary\nneoplastic vs. GI-infectious vs. GI/systemic infectious. See\nabove. Nothing on history/exam to suggest primary rheumatologic\ndisorder, ESR 13,  negative. He was scheduled for a lymph\nnode biopsy (his R inguinal lymph node seemed the largest),\nexcisional by surgery. However, he refused this. Contact legal\nguardian   as well as PCP regarding this issue. Pt\ninitially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes. However,\nlater on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymph\nnodes was to look for \"cancer\" and then stated that he would\nnever have a biospy. Discussed this with patient's PCP and legal\nguardian who did not want to force (by physical or chemical\nrestraint) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will.\nDiscussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple times\nand he did decline, but agrees to follow up with his PCP for\nfurther evaluation.\n.\n# Acute Renal Failure w/ proteinuria: Lack of schistocytes on\ninitial smear argued against TTP etiology. Likely pre-renal,\nperhaps due to poor po intake. unclear if he was hypotensive in\nthe ED. FENa suggested prerenal etiology. Creatinine improved to\nbaseline. He should have chemistries/electrolytes followed after\ndischarge. Creatinine on discharge 1.6.\n.\n# Altered mental status, from opiates received in the ED now\nresolved. He was initially admitted to the ICU given his\nunresponsiveness after opiates. This resolved after being given\nnarcan and never reoccurred.\n.\n# Anemia - His B12, folate, and iron were normal. Smear was\nchecked in ICU and only rare schistocytes were seen. HIV Ab was\nnegative. His hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 30.1\non day of discharge without evidence of bleeding. This is likely\ndue CKD. However, given recent abdominal pain and anemia pt\nshould undergo a colonoscopy.\n.\n# Thrombocytopenia - He was found to have thrombocytopenia,\nthought to be subacute, given that he had 130K one month ago.\nHis platelets were monitored and normalized. Splenomegaly not\nnoted on imaging. HIV negative. Could have been due to\nmedications or acute illness.\n.\n# Ascites - new finding. Had not been tapped b/c ICU felt not\ntappable. No known chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.\nConsidered lymphoma, occult cirrhosis, TB peritonitis on\ndifferential given +PPD, abdominal pain, weight loss. TB\nenteritis normal affects IC valve area which he does not\nradiographically/clinically have. RUQ US was without significant\nascites, not enough to tap; no cirrhosis noted. This could be\ndue to heart failure, but is likely due to low albumin.\nQuantiferon gold PENDING at time of discharge.\n.\n# Hypertension - He was continued on his home regimen, although\nit was found that he wasn't filling these prescriptions as an\noutpt. Given proteinuria, he was (re-)started on an ACE-I. He\nwas also started on spironolactone given his heart failure and\nhypertension (after drawing renin and aldosterone). He was\nstarted on beta blocker given dCHF.\n- With chronic hypokalemia, sent renin / aldosterone levels\nsince these have never been sent, to rule out\nhyperaldonsteronism. These are still PENDING at time of\ndischarge.\n.\n# Hypokalemia- see above, concern for hyperaldo. Repleted dialy.\nPt started on spironolactone and still required supplementation\nof potassium. Suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by\n given CKD and use of spironolactone. Pt should have his\npotassium checked regularly.\n.\n# Lymphadenopathy - bilateral inguinal and axillary. He denied\nfevers and chills, but noted weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, ahnd\nelevated LDH,  suggested biopsy to r/o TB, lymphoma (with flow\ncytommetry), etc.  Surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of LN,\nbut pt refused. Pt refused on multiple occasions. See above. PCP\nand legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo procedures\nand testing that he did not want. Pt was aware that biopsy was\nsuggested to r/o cancer.\n.\n# Positive PPD (untreated) - CXR was performed without note of\ntuberculous disease INH is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency.\n.\n# Pericardial Effusion - likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia.\nMild per ECHO (not large as reported on CT), no signs of\ntamponade. Other DDx = TB (though usually much larger), other\nRheum disorders (unlikely by hx/exam). This was likely due to\nhypoalbumenemia.\n.\n# Long QT: Present also on EKG . His potassium was\nrepleted. QTC remained ~440 with haldol dosing. Serial EKG were\nperformed. Pt's haldol dose was decreased to 5mg from 10mg due\nto this. EKG's should be monitored in outpatient setting.\n.\n# Lacunar infarct, clincally quiescent: Seen on head CT, and new\n\nsince . Would recommend outpatient workup for PFO, etc.\n.\n# Psych: schizophrenia, formerly pleasant did become\ninexplicably agitated about prospect of getting LN biopsy. Pt\nfound to lack capacity by psychiatry and found to have a legal\nguardian- . Pt's guardian was updated on pt's\nclinical course and as above did not want to pursue restraints\n(physical/chemical) in order to enforce biopsy. Pt was taken off\nhis depakote during admission given altered mental status and\nthis should be resumed upon discharge. Pt's haldol was decreased\nto 5mg from 10mg given above. Pt remained pleasant throughout\nthe remainder of the hospitalization.\n.\nTransitional items for follow up\n1.EKG monitoring for QTC\n2.follow renal function and electrolytes given recent\nARF/hypokalemia\n3.f/u labs still pending at time of discharge quantiferon gold,\nrenin/aldosterone, histoplasma antigen\n4.consider colonoscopy\n5.consider lymph node biopsy\n6.lasix dose titration prn\n.\nDVT PPx: Heparin SC\n.\nLines: PIV\n.\nCODE: FULL",

Upon\nadmission, she was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and the\nPain service was consulted for placement of an epidural catheter\nfor analgesic control of rib pain.\n\nOn HD #1,  she was admitted to the trauma intensive care unit\nfor placement of a thoracic epidural catheter for pain control.\nA foley catheter was also placed.  Because of her history of\nETOH, she was placed on a CIWA scale. Her rib pain was\ncontrolled but she continued to have episodes of desaturation.\nShe was encouraged to use the incentive spirometer and her\noxygen saturations improved.  She was transferred to the\nsurgical floor on HD #3.\n\nShe was transferred to the trauma intensive care unit on HD #4\nwith shortness of breath. A chest x-ray did show a fluid\ncollection and a chest tube was placed for a hemothorax of\n700cc.  Her respiratory status improved with placement of the\nchest tube.  During this time, she also had episodes of\nconfusion which were thought to be related to her narcotic\nanalgesia.  Her mental status cleared once her narcotics were\ndiscontinued. She did require 2 units of PRBC for a hematocrit\nof 22.  After the transfusion, her hematorcrit increased to 30.\n\n\nShe was transferred to the surgical floor on HD #5.  At this\ntime, her chest tube was placed to water seal and she maintained\nadequate oxygenation.  She was encouraged to use the incentive\nspirometer.   She was evaluated by physical therapy and she\ndemonstrated functional mobility necessary for discharge home.\n\nHer chest tube was discontinued on HD # 9 and she had a chest\nx-ray done after removal. Her vital signs are stable and she is\nafebrile.  She is tolertating a regular diet.  She has been\nambulating without any shortness of breath.\n\nThe social worker has been in to visit and provided with options\nfor additional counselling upon discharge. Home safety issues\nwere addressed and patient reportedly feels comfortable with her\nspouse.\n\nShe is preparing for discharge to her daughter's home.  She will\nfollow up with the acute care service in 3 weeks.  She has been\ninstructed that she is not allowed to fly for 1 month.\n\nOf note:  your chest x-ray did show multifocal, nondependent\nground-glass opacities, predominantly in the right lung.  Your\nprimary care provider   on this.  Acute care\nclinic called on  and informed that patient will need a\ncopy of discharge summary to bring to her primary care provider.",

ACS\nruled out by neg EKG, enzymes, and poor story for angina. Pt was\nalso found to be in severe acute dCHF with frank anasarca. MRI\nof chest/abdomen was negative for dissection and PE, however\npoor image quality and heparin was continued. Initial echo\nshowed mild to moderate pericardial effusion, which, on repeat\necho, was worsening, associated with wider pulsus paradoxus (see\nbelow). Please see below, ultimately it was felt that her chest\npain was a result of recurrent pericarditis. She was treated\nwith colchicine and PO hydromorphone with good response.\n.\n# Pericarditis and pericardial effusion:  Patient was found to\nhave pulsus paradoxus and tamponade physiology on echo.  She\nunderwent pericardiocentesis on . Post-pericardiocentesis,\nthe patient was transferred to CCU for close monitoring.  She\nintermittently continued to experience left sided, pleuritic\nchest pain, requiring opioids for adequate relief. Repeat\nbedside TTEs daily x 2 days following pericardiocentesis\nrevealed only trivial pericardial effusion.  Pericardial drain\nwas pulled on .  Given patient's multiple allergies,\nincluding to NSAIDS, patient was put on colchicine for\npericarditis.  On transfer back to the floor on , patient's\nchest pain was better controlled. Workup for etiology of\npericardial effusion included negative RF and . dsDNA is\npending.  Furthermore, patient had no viral prodrome prior to\nadmission. On  the patient had normal vital signs and\nnegative pulsus.\n.\n# Anemia: Likely secondary to anemia of inflammation.  SPEP,\nelevated erythropoetin, elevated haptoglobin. Given patient is\nguaiac positive, concern for GI bleed if HCT dropping rapidly,\nhowever pt is having her period, and HCTs have been stable.\nPatient did not require any transfusion during this admission.\n.\n# Chronic Kidney Disease: Likely HTN and DM induced. Baseline\nbetween 1.2 and 2.0. She had acute kidney injury with Cr to 2.3\nin the setting of diuresis and tamponade likely causing prerenal\nkidney injury.  Diuretics were held then gently restarted on a\nlower dose (40 mg daily from 80 mg ) at discharge.\n.\n# DM: Pt with elevated BS on admission, no gap.  Home regimen of\n50units of glargine and ISS were continued.\n.\n# HTN: Patient's home regimen was continued with reasonable\ncontrol of blood pressure.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin was switched to pravastatin after\ncolchicine was started to redue the risk of rhabdomyolysis.\n.\n# Psych: Citalopram and clonazepam were continued per outpatient\nregimen.\n\nThe patient received a diabetic/heart healthy/low salt diet.\nShe received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  She was full code.\n\n\nTO BE FOLLOWED OUTPATIENT\n1) INR - patient restarted on coumadin on 2) BMP - patient restarted on lasix, had ARF\n3) Acute Renal Failure - patient had ARF in the setting of\ntamponade, evaluate for resolution\n4) Pericarditis/Tamponade - patient had rheumatologic labs drawn\nin idiopathic tamponade workup (dsDNA and ANCA), pending at",

ECG showed lateral ST-changes. Continued\non heparin and plavix loaded. On the floor pt denied CP, SOB. Pt\ninitially refused catheterization fearing it might lead to\naccelerated need for hemodialysis. After several conversations\nw/ attending physician,  weighed risks and benefits of\nprocedure and agreed to proceed. Pt appeared overloaded prior to\nprocedure, and received 60 IV lasix X 2 with good urine output.\nHe was still mildly volume positive before catheterization,\njudged to be acceptable in the setting of ESRD. He received left\nheart catheterization , revealing signficant disease with\ncomplicated lesions in his LAD and LCx. However, he received a\nlarge amount of dye and his case was aborted given the desire to\navoid the need for hemodialysis given his ESRD.\n\nThe patient remained chest pain free between his diagnostic cath\n and therapeutic cath  on maximal medical regimen\nincluding heparin gtt (48 hrs) ASA 325mg, plavix, metoprolol and\nstatin.\n\nOn , the patient had a DES to Ramus and DES to LCx/OM2. He\n the procedure well. He has follow-up with his\noutpatient cardiologist Dr.  in the coming weeks.\n\nESRD.\n\nPt had AVF placed six months prior to this admission, and\nrevision two weeks prior. Pt desires transplant and expressed\nstrong wish to postpone dialysis as long as possible. Renal\nconsulted for management of catheterization in setting of ESRD;\nrecommended simultaneous hydration and diuresis. Unfortunately\nafter cath , patient creatinine began to rise from 3.5 to\n8.8, necessitating urgent dialysis. Unfortunately, the patient's\nAV fistula was still too immature for use and a tunnel catheter\nwas placed . Mr   dialysis well and went for\nsubsequent treatments after his second cardiac cath . He has\nbeen discharged with outpatient dialysis MWF, which he will\nlikely require long term. He also has outpatient follow up with\nthe transplant service.\n\nDirty UA with positive Urine culture\nThe patient had a dirty UA and a positive urine culture that\ngrew Klebsiella. The patient was asymptomatic. He completed a 7\nday course of ciprofloxacin while in house.\n\nDepression\nWhile in house, the patient had passive suicidal ideations and a\ndepressed mood. He was seen by psychiatry, who recommended long\nterm therapy and medication. The patient refused both. The\npsychiatry team spoke with the  health care proxy and\nsister in law, who felt the patient was not safe at home with a\nfirearm. Psych had the local police department (for whom the\npatient used to work) confiscate Mr  firearm from his\nhome. The patient denies any homicidal or suicidal ideations at\ndischarge.\n\nAnemia\nThe patient appeared to have anemia from iron deficiency and\nchronic kidney disease. Guaiac of stools was negative. He was\nkept on PO iron and also received EPO treatments at dialysis.\n\nPast Hx of Fournier's Gangrene c/b bowel resection.\nThe patient had no active issues with his ostomy site.\n\nDiabetes\nThe patient had 2 episodes of AM hypoglycemia. His basal insulin\ndose was decreased and his bolus doses were increased to limit\npost-prandial hyperglycemia.\n\nTransitional Issues\n\nThe patient is confirmed DNR/DNI\n\nHe will continue to follow up with Nephrology at dialysis. He\nalso has an appointment with the transplant team. The patient's\nfistula should continue to be monitored to determine when it\nwill be mature enough for use. Hopefully, he will not need the\ntunnel catheter for a prolonged period of time.\n\nCardiologist Dr  will monitor for symptoms of angina\npost-cath.

Mr.  was also started on an Ace\ninhibitor, initially captopril so we could uptitrate it and then\nswitched to lisinopril. He was also started on a beta blocker\nwhich was changed to Toprol XL upon discharge. His cardiac\nenzymes peaked on HD #2 (CK 1356, MB 159, index 11.7, troponin\n4.37). Pt was counselled regarding smoking cessation, as well as\neducated from nutrition consult regarding a cardiac diet.\n\nb.

This was weaned off over HD #1.\nPt was positive in fluid status by 3 L over HD #1 and 2, and had\nslight crackles at his bases. He autodiuresed and was euvolemic\non discharge, requiring no diuretics.\n\nc.

He had >20 runs\nof NSVT 3->20 beats throughout the evening/night of admission,\nasymptomatic, and hemodynamically stable. His electrolytes were\nchecked and potassium was found to be 3.1, magnesium 1.7. Those\nwere repleted.

Urine and blood tox screen were negative on\nadmission. The toxicology service was consulted in the ED and\nrecommended phenobarbital for control of GHB withdrawal\nsymptoms, with benzos as 2nd line if ineffective.  In the ICU,\nhe was started on a regimen of phenobarbital 30mg TID\n(long-acting) with valium 5-10mg PRN for anxiety in between\ndosing.  Both of these meds were initially given IV, but were\ntransitioned to PO overnight.  Since rhabomyolysis is a risk of\nGHB withdrawal, CKs were checked and IVF continued at 200cc/hr\ninitially without any change in renal function.  EKG did not\nshow any QRS or QT prolongation or ST changes indicative of\nischemia.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.

        "Brief Hospital Course": "# Respiratory failure/Methemeglobinemia:  The patient was\nintubated with sats in the high 90s after methylene blue.  ABGs\nshowed improving trend.  Methemeglobinemia likely over at point\nof transfer to MICU.  Weaned off vent to CPAP and was extubated\nin the afternoon on  by the pulmonary team.  Cardiac enzymes\nwere trended and were stable.  Reglan was held. Toxicology\nfollowed during stay in MICU and methylene blue was redosed.\n.\n# Thyroid & Esphageal Carcinoma: Intent of care remained\npalliative during this admission. Chemoradiation was deemed to\nnot have made a significant impact on the patient's symptoms,\nwhich continue to be cough, difficulty breathing / talking, and\ndysphagia. The decision was made to stop further chemotherapy\nand pursue potential surgical avenues for further palliation. A\nnumber of medication changes were also made, including starting\nMirtazapine for appetite stimulation per palliative care, and\nAcetylcysteine and Codeine/Guiafenesin to promote productive\ncoughing.\n.\n# Transient hypotension: The patient developed transient\nhypotension in the setting of propofol boluses, diarrhea.\nHypovolemia also possible given sinus tach.  Blood pressure\nnormalized with fluid boluses and in the absence of fever or\nleukocytosis, sepsis was deemed unlikely and empiric Vanc/Zosyn\nwas discontinued.\n.\n# ARF: Recent elevation this month in the setting of new chemo,\npossibly prerenal from chemo associated diarrhea. Cr remained\nstable at 1.2; the patient was discharge with Cr 1.1.\n# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia normalized from 132 to\n139 upon discharge with volume resuscitation.",

Echocardiogram\non  while on intra-aortic balloon pump showed EF of 45%,\nmild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w\ninferoposterior infarction. Once hypotension had resolved, he\nwas started on metoprolol and captopril and was discharged on\n.\n\n#. Coronaries: He presented to OSH with STEMI c/b vfib arrest in\nemergency department. Emergent catheterization at OSH showed\nsevere 2 vessel disease with 100% occlusion in left circumflex,\n40% mid-LAD disease, sequential 90% proximal 70% distal and 90%\nostial RCA lesions. He received BMS x2 to left circumflex at\nOSH, and was transferred to  for possible intervention on\nRCA. Received ASA 325mg, plavix load of 600mg; and was\nsubsequentially started on ASA 325mg, plavix 75mg, and\natorvostatin 80mg. When cardiogenic shock resolved, patient was\nalso started on metoprolol succinate 100mg daily and lisinopril\n10mg daily. Patient will need further risk factor modification\nfor secondary prevention with better BP and lipid control.\n\n# LE Cramping/ poor peripheral pulses: On review of symptoms,\npatient complained of lower extremity cramping with exertion,\npoor dorsal pedial pulses, and symptoms concerning for lower\nextremity ischemia upon femoral artery vascular access.  ABI\nshowed severe flow deficit of right lower extremity and\nsignificant left tibial disease. This will need to followed as\nan outpatient and referral to vascular surgery may be\nappropriate.\n\n#. s/p endotracheal intubation: Patient was emergently intubated\nfollowing post-arrest agitation for airway protection; requiring\nminimal ventilatory support.  Following resolution of\ncardiogenic shock, patient was successfully extubated on .\nImmediately following extubation, patient transientally\ndesaturated to mid 80s from mild pulmonary edema and mucus\nplugging with possible VAP.  Treated successfully with lasix and\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics.  Respiratory status improved with\nlasix and by  he was no longer requiring supplemental O2.\n\n#. Elevated CK: Upon admission, patient had CK elevated to 2604\nwhich trended up to 8716 during course of hospitalization.\nEtiology was multifactorial from myocardial infarction, muscle\ninjury from cardiac resuscitation and early lower extremity\nischemia during intra-aortic balloon pump placement.  Myocardial\nischemia was treated as above.  CK trended down once balloon\npump was removed.  Renal function was trended and there was no\nevidence of myoglobinuria or renal injury associated with\nelevated CK.\n\n#.  Fever: on , patient developed fever to 101.5.\nInfectious evaluation with blood culture, urinalysis/ culture,\nsputum culture and CXR was concerning for ventilator associated\nPNA. Groin lines (IABP, a-line) also may have been source of\ninfection/ fever.  Patient was started on broad spectrum\nantibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime for HAP/ possible line\ninfection. Sputum culture was growing GNR and GPCs.  Fever curve\nand WBC count was trended.\n\n#. Transaminitis: Likely shock liver in the setting of VF arrest\nwith cardiogenic shock. LFTs trended down thoughout his\nhospitalization. Patient's underlying alcohol abuse may have\nalso contributed to elevated LFTs.",

The pt was initially admitted to the\nMedicine service with a chief complaint of fevers with cough\nthought to be due to aspiration PNA on . At the time, she\nwas hypertensive to 193/125. She was started on her home cardiac\nregimen of metoprolol XL 25mg once daily on  AM.\nThroughout the course of the day of , the pt continued to\nhave a HR of 40s to 50s with systolic blood pressure of 110-130s\nand some degree of mental status change with lethargy. On\n at 22:23, a trigger was called for a heart rate of 30s\nwith SBP of 100s. The NF intern was called to assess the pt and\nfound the pt to be completely obtunded and unresponsive to\nverbal or physical stimuli (sternal rub) with GCS score of .\nThe pt was given atropine 0.5mg x3 as well as glucagon 5mg x2,\n3mg x1 and calcium 1 amp without effect. The son who was present\nat the time confirmed, this was a far cry from her mother's\nbaseline mental status where she is normally communicative.\n\nDuring transfer to the  and placement of foley catheter and\narterial line, the HR increased to 40s-50s with increase in\nsystolic blood pressure to 110-140s. In addition, the pt\nregained some degree of mental status and was able to interact.\nShe remained with HR >30 in the , without further\nobtundation.  All beta blockers were held.\n\n1. Bradycardia - Likely due to conduction abnormality rather\nthan BB. Initially patient had HR in the 30's with MS changes\nand low BP.  For remainder of the hospital course, HR in 50's\nwith few episodes in 30's. Her EKGs show afib with slow\nventricular response. Per cardiology consult, no need for\ntranscutaneous pacer was warranted given her poor prognosis.\nBradycardia may be secondary to intrinsic conduction disease vs.\nvagal response. Likely not  to BB given that last dose was on\n.\n\n2. Mental status changes - Initial obtundation likely  poor\nperfusion from bradycardia. CT of head  was negative.\nInfectious work-up was also negative from admission.  Considered\nMRI/MRA to evaluate for further progression of vascular dementia\nif mental status were to deteriorate; however, MS improved back\nto baseline after bradycardia resolved.\n\n3. CAD - Pt had no symptoms of CP, and helding BB in setting of\nbradycardia, although this would be beneficial in CAD.  Per PCP,\n held  h/o GI bleed while pt was on both  and coumadin.\n Imdur was also changed to isosorbide dinitrate as imdur cannot\nbe crushed.\n\n4. Afib - Held coumadin for supertherapeutic INR; restarted when\nINR<2.\n\n5. CHF - Pt has h/o CHF with unknown EF; baseline TTE during\nthis hospitalization showed EF >55%.  Continued lasix and\nnitrate; recommended monitoring of daily weights.\n\n6. Aspiration PNA - Pt had no signs of PNA on CXR, but pt was\nadmitted with fevers and productive cough concerning for URI.\nHas a h/o aspiration PNA in the past. Pt was started on\nlevofloxacin on initial admission and completed a 7 day course.\nShe had a speech and swallow evaluation: they recommended thin\nliquid and purees, with assistance while eating, crushed meds,\nbasic aspiration precautions.\n\n7. NIDDM - Continued on lantus 32 units qAM and RISS\n\n8. Hypothyroidism - Continued synthroid.\n\n9. Decreased Hct - Baseline Hct is 28-31.  She had no evidence\nof active bleeding.  She was given iron supplements.\n\n10. Sacral decub - She had no evidence of wound infections;\ncontinued ascorbic acid and zinc supplements.\n\n11.

She developed\ntachycardia and dyspnea/hypoxia during a CTA chest to rule out\nPE, so was transferred to the ICU from the radiology suite.  In\nthe ICU, she had fever to 104, rigors, and hypotension, then\ndeveloped worsening dyspnea/hypoxia after fluid rescusitation in\nthe ED and was found to have MSSA sepsis.\n.\n# Hypoxia/dyspnea: Transferred to ICU for dyspnea and hypoxemia\nto mid-80s during CTA chest, initially thought to be anaphylaxis\nfrom IV contrast.  CTA was negative for PE.  New O2 requirement\nof 4L since admission with evidence of small b/l pleural\neffusions and volume overload on exam.  She had received 10L IV\nfluids in first 24hr of admission to ICU for severe sepsis.  BNP\n1459.  Echo showing new RV dilatation, but normal EF.  History\nof post-partum cardiomyopathy and has been getting trastuzumab.\nHypoxia/dyspnea improving with furosemide.  Cardiology\nconsulted; they felt the RV dilation was minimal and trastuzumab\ncould be safely continued.  Diuresed with furosemide for acute\ndiastolic CHF (apical ballooning syndrome/Takotsubo?).  Weight\nreturned back to baseline.  Stopped furosemide at discharge.\nDaily weights and strict Ins/Outs.  Changed diltiazem to\nmetoprolol for CHF management.  Titrated up metoprolol from 25mg\n to TID.  Continued aspirin as long as PLTs remain >50.\nIpratroprium PRN.  Restarted  at 1/2 dose as outpatient given\nnew metoprolol.  Losartan was held since 1st day of admission\ndue to hypotension.\n- SHE WILL NEED A REPEAT ECHO IN ONE MONTH.\n.\n# Bacteremia: MSSA in blood, source pustular rash, which also\ngrew MSSA.  Vancomycin started , then changed to\ncefazolin due to sensitivities and PCN allergy.  TTE negative\nfor endocarditis, but did show new RV dilatation (see above).\nTEE negative for endocarditis.
